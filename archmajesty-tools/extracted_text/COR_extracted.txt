Archmajesty
 
is
 
a
 
deck-building
 
tabletop
 
tactics
 
&
 
roleplaying
 
game
 
design
 
for
 
1
 
gamemaster
 
(“GM”)
 
and
 
1-3
 
players.
 
Each
 
card
 
represents
 
a
 
magic
 
spell,
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
chained
 
together
 
to
 
devastating
 
effect.
 
 
Each
 
player
 
creates
 
a
 
mage
 
by
 
choosing
 
from
 
210
 
different
 
cards
 
and
 
then
 
constructing
 
a
 
21-card
 
deck.
 
 
Combat
 
encounters
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
focus
 
of
 
the
 
ruleset,
 
presenting
 
each
 
player
 
with
 
tactical
 
encounters
 
that
 
challenge
 
their
 
ability
 
to
 
strategize,
 
position
 
themselves,
 
and
 
adapt
 
to
 
a
 
wide
 
variety
 
of
 
unique
 
threats.

Archmajesty

specifically
 
those
 
with
 
custom
 
card
 
support
 
like
 
Tabletop

The

Introduction
 
INTRODUCTION
 
Design
 
Transparency
 
Archmajesty
 
is
 
written
 
for
 
those
 
who
 
already
 
have
 
a
 
basic
 
understanding
 
of
 
what
 
constitutes
 
a
 
tabletop
 
roleplaying
 
game.
 
So
 
rather
 
than
 
introduce
 
the
 
game
 
with
 
a
 
boilerplate
 
“What
 
is
 
a
 
TRPG?”
 
section,
 
the
 
introduction
 
will
 
detail
 
the
 
intentions
 
behind
 
the
 
system’s
 
design.
 
 
Archmajesty
 
is
 
explicitly
 
a
 
combat-focused
 
game
 
with
 
a
 
lighter
 
ruleset
 
for
 
non-combat
 
interaction.
 
Because
 
of
 
the
 
way
 
the
 
game's
 
card-based,
 
grid-based
 
tactical
 
combat
 
is
 
handled,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
recommended
 
you
 
create
 
or
 
alter
 
new
 
rules
 
for
 
your
 
campaign
 
until
 
you
 
understand
 
the
 
core
 
gameplay
 
experience.
 
 
The
 
scale
 
of
 
combat
 
encounters
 
may
 
also
 
seem
 
unusual
 
at
 
first,
 
with
 
the
 
players
 
regularly
 
facing
 
large
 
amounts
 
of
 
enemies
 
in
 
multiple
 
waves
 
not
 
unlike
 
a
 
spectacle
 
fighter.
 
The
 
game
 
was
 
designed
 
to
 
balance
 
and
 
streamline
 
its
 
card-based
 
gameplay,
 
a
 
large
 
enemy
 
count,
 
and
 
a
 
turn
 
times
 
that
 
are
 
kept
 
to
 
a
 
reasonable
 
length.
 
 
When
 
engaged
 
in
 
combat,
 
players
 
will
 
regularly
 
resolve
 
5
 
or
 
more
 
cards
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
turn,
 
with
 
each
 
card
 
being
 
roughly
 
equivalent
 
to
 
an
 
attack
 
action
 
or
 
spell
 
in
 
other
 
games.
 
This
 
may
 
feel
 
overwhelming
 
at
 
first,
 
but
 
the
 
game
 
is
 
designed
 
to
 
write
 
most
 
of
 
the
 
complexity
 
onto
 
the
 
cards
 
in
 
your
 
hand
 
rather
 
than
 
spread
 
out
 
across
 
multiple
 
pages
 
and
 
chapters.
 
 
As
 
you
 
become
 
familiar
 
with
 
your
 
mage’s
 
fighting
 
style,
 
it
 
will
 
become
 
second
 
nature
 
to
 
resolve
 
your
 
spell
 
combos,
 
resulting
 
in
 
surprisingly
 
snappy
 
rounds.
 
 
For
 
gamemasters,
 
Archmajesty
 
was
 
designed
 
specifically
 
to
 
allow
 
for
 
encounters
 
to
 
be
 
put
 
together
 
quickly.
 
Within
 
the
 
core
 
rule
 
set
 
are
 
several
 
guides
 
for
 
encounter
 
building
 
rules
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
a
 
vast
 
source
 
of
 
pre-made
 
enemies
 
known
 
as
 
the
 
Adversarium.
 
 
While
 
the
 
system
 
can
 
theoretically
 
handle
 
any
 
number
 
of
 
players,
 
it
 
was
 
specifically
 
designed
 
around
 
a
 
1-3
 
person
 
party.
 
Party
 
counts
 
of
 
4
 
or
 
more
 
players
 
aren’t
 
recommended
 
for
 
inexperienced
 
players
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
way
 
encounters
 
are
 
mechanically
 
scaled.
 
 
 
Deckbuilding
 
Basics
 
Each
 
player
 
has
 
a
 
deck
 
of
 
21
 
cards.
 
You
 
cannot
 
have
 
more
 
than
 
3
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
card
 
in
 
your
 
deck.
 
To
 
make
 
your
 
deck,
 
you
 
are
 
given
 
6
 
style
 
points
 
during
 
the
 
character
 
creation
 
process
 
that
 
are
 
spent
 
to
 
acquire
 
various
 
primary
 
and
 
secondary
 
fighting
 
styles.
 
 
✦
 
Primary
 
styles
 
grant
 
ten
 
cards
 
and
 
cost
 
2
 
points.
 
✦
 
Secondary
 
styles
 
grant
 
five
 
cards
 
and
 
cost
 
1
 
point.
 
 
You
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
acquire
 
the
 
same
 
style
 
more
 
than
 
once.
 
If
 
this
 
results
 
in
 
you
 
gaining
 
more
 
than
 
3
 
copies
 
of
 
a
 
card,
 
you
 
may
 
convert
 
those
 
spare
 
cards
 
at
 
a
 
1:1
 
ratio
 
into
 
any
 
Arcanist
 
Arte
 
card.
 
 
After
 
character
 
creation,
 
you
 
can
 
acquire
 
new
 
cards
 
by
 
reaching
 
story
 
milestones,
 
reading
 
ancient
 
tomes,
 
being
 
taught
 
by
 
another
 
mage,
 
or
 
any
 
other
 
means
 
as
 
dictated
 
by
 
your
 
GM.
 
 
Early
 
on
 
in
 
a
 
campaign
 
you
 
may
 
find
 
that
 
you
 
don’t
 
“gel”
 
with
 
your
 
character’s
 
playstyle.
 
In
 
these
 
situations,
 
it
 
is
 
perfectly
 
acceptable
 
to
 
ask
 
your
 
GM
 
to
 
recreate
 
your
 
character
 
by
 
going
 
through
 
the
 
character
 
creation
 
process
 
again.
 
Ability
 
Basics
 
Each
 
character
 
has
 
access
 
to
 
numerous
 
abilities
 
from
 
their
 
ancestry
 
and
 
the
 
fighting
 
styles
 
they
 
know.
 
Abilities
 
are
 
simple
 
active
 
and
 
passive
 
effects
 
that
 
synergize
 
with
 
your
 
character’s
 
unique
 
fighting
 
style,
 
and
 
can
 
greatly
 
affect
 
the
 
way
 
they
 
are
 
played.
 
 
Acquiring
 
an
 
ability
 
doesn’t
 
automatically
 
grant
 
you
 
access
 
to
 
its
 
effects
 
as
 
you
 
must
 
also
 
equip
 
that
 
ability
 
by
 
allocating
 
your
 
ability
 
slots
 
to
 
it.
 
Each
 
style
 
ability
 
costs
 
at
 
least
 
1
 
ability
 
slot
 
to
 
equip.
 
You
 
can
 
regain
 
ability
 
slots
 
at
 
any
 
point
 
outside
 
of
 
an
 
encounter
 
by
 
unequipping
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
abilities.
 
Item
 
Basics
 
Like
 
abilities,
 
each
 
character
 
has
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
wide
 
array
 
of
 
weapons,
 
armour,
 
and
 
consumable
 
items
 
useful
 
in
 
combat
 
situations.
 
Items
 
can
 
be
 
equipped
 
by
 
allocating
 
your
 
equipment
 
slots
 
to
 
them.
 
 
✦
 
When
 
playing
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
weapon
 
specified
 
in
 
its
 
range
 
entry,
 
you
 
may
 
choose
 
one
 
compatible
 
weapon
 
you
 
have
 
equipped
 
and
 
channel
 
that
 
spell
 
through
 
it.
 
✦
 
You
 
may
 
only
 
have
 
one
 
piece
 
of
 
head
 
armour
 
and
 
one
 
piece
 
of
 
body
 
armour
 
equipped
 
at
 
any
 
one
 
time.
 
✦
 
Consumable
 
items
 
regain
 
all
 
of
 
their
 
uses
 
after
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
combat
 
encounter.
 
 
Players
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
unique
 
magic
 
items
 
called
 
artefacts
 
which
 
can
 
be
 
equipped
 
using
 
your
 
character’s
 
ability
 
slots,
 
equipment
 
slots,
 
or
 
a
 
mix
 
of
 
both.

Introduction
 
Rolling
 
Basics
 
During
 
gameplay,
 
you
 
will
 
be
 
prompted
 
by
 
your
 
Gamemaster
 
who
 
will
 
set
 
a
 
static
 
number
 
called
 
a
 
difficulty
 
threshold
 
(usually
 
shortened
 
to
 
DT)
 
and
 
then
 
ask
 
you
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
roll.
 
 
This
 
involves
 
rolling
 
a
 
D20
 
which
 
determines
 
your
 
natural
 
result.
 
You
 
then
 
add
 
all
 
the
 
relevant
 
modifiers
 
to
 
that
 
natural
 
result
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
final
 
result.
 
Lastly,
 
you
 
compare
 
your
 
final
 
result
 
to
 
the
 
DT.
 
If
 
your
 
final
 
result
 
is
 
equal
 
to,
 
or
 
higher
 
than
 
the
 
DT,
 
you
 
succeed.
 
Otherwise,
 
you
 
fail.
 
 
Your
 
Gamemaster
 
may
 
interpret
 
the
 
scale
 
of
 
your
 
success
 
or
 
failure
 
depending
 
on
 
how
 
far
 
over
 
or
 
under
 
your
 
final
 
result
 
was.
 
The
 
Compendium
 
As
 
a
 
companion
 
to
 
the
 
core
 
rule
 
set
 
of
 
Archmajesty
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
volume
 
of
 
the
 
Arcane
 
Compendium.
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
of
 
many
 
books
 
that
 
offer
 
unique
 
primary
 
and
 
secondary
 
fighting
 
styles,
 
Arcanist
 
Artes,
 
and

Create-a-Mage
 
CREATING
 
A
 
MAGE
 
Mages
 
come
 
in
 
many
 
forms.
 
Some
 
are
 
trained
 
from
 
childhood
 
as
 
mage’s
 
apprentices,
 
while
 
others
 
display
 
a
 
natural
 
talent
 
for
 
magic.
 
Some
 
don’t
 
even
 
display
 
their
 
arcane
 
potential
 
until
 
much
 
later
 
in
 
life.
 
 
Each
 
mage
 
is
 
incredibly
 
powerful,
 
capable
 
of
 
dispatching
 
groups
 
of
 
trained
 
soldiers
 
without
 
much
 
problem.
  
They
 
can
 
call
 
storm
 
clouds
 
to
 
irrigate
 
entire
 
fields
 
with
 
a
 
snap
 
of
 
their
 
finger,
 
raise
 
great
 
pillars
 
of
 
stone
 
with
 
a
 
flick
 
of
 
the
 
wrist,
 
and
 
conjure
 
lightning
 
merely
 
by
 
holding
 
a
 
finger
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
sky.
 
 
With
 
such
 
great
 
power
 
comes
 
a
 
great
 
responsibility
 
as
 
is
 
written
 
in
 
the
 
teachings
 
of
 
Azir
 
-
 
the
 
legendary
 
archmage
 
who
 
founded
 
Haijhan
 
and
 
its
 
great
 
academy.
 
 
 
The
 
mages
 
of
 
Azirland
 
(
including
 
you
)
 
are
 
tasked
 
with
 
helping
 
those
 
who
 
lack
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
wield
 
magic,
 
and
 
to
 
aid
 
those
 
who
 
cannot
 
protect
 
themselves
 
against
 
bandits,
 
dictators,
 
and
 
corrupt
 
mages.
 
 
While
 
some
 
mages
 
act
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
accord,
 
most
 
mages
 
within
 
Azirland
 
pledge
 
themselves
 
to
 
the
 
State
 
Magistry,
 
which
 
coordinates
 
the
 
unique
 
talents
 
of
 
each
 
state-mage
 
to
 
better
 
the
 
whole
 
of
 
the
 
country
 
in
 
times
 
of
 
peace
 
-
 
and
 
dispatch
 
them
 
against
 
the
 
enemy
 
in
 
times
 
of
 
war.
 
 
To
 
create
 
your
 
mage,
 
follow
 
these
 
steps:
 
✦
 
Step
 
I
:
 
Choose
 
an
 
ancestry.
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
✦
 
Step
 
II
:
 
Determine
 
your
 
attributes.
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
✦
 
Step
 
III
:
 
Acquire
 
your
 
fighting
 
styles.
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
✦
 
Step
 
IV
:
 
Items
 
&
 
Artefacts
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
✦
 
Step
 
V
:
 
Establish
 
your
 
background
 
by
 
determining
 
your
 
mage’s
 
aspects,
 
circles,
 
and
 
lores.
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
 
 
 
Step
 
I:
 
Ancestry
 
Urn
 
is
 
the
 
confluent
 
point
 
of
 
several
 
missing
 
civilizations,
 
peoples
 
-
 
and
 
in
 
some
 
cases
 
-
 
entire
 
continents.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
many
 
different
 
beings
 
roam
 
the
 
Ironlands.
 
Of
 
those,
 
eight
 
are
 
presented
 
here
 
as
 
playable
 
ancestries
 
with
 
each
 
having
 
their
 
own
 
physical
 
and
 
mental
 
traits,
 
cultural
 
differences,
 
and
 
ideological
 
distinctions.
 
 
In
 
a
 
world
 
of
 
chaotic
 
magic,
 
the
 
idea
 
of
 
ancestry
 
can
 
be
 
quite
 
fluid.
 
Someone
 
could
 
physically
 
be
 
a
 
human,
 
but
 
due
 
to
 
enhancing
 
themselves
 
with
 
mechanical
 
limbs,
 
or
 
a
 
freak
 
accident
 
they
 
could
 
manifest
 
abilities
 
more
 
similar
 
to
 
a
 
svartal.
 
This
 
extends
 
to
 
those
 
descended
 
from
 
mixed
 
heritage,
 
who
 
may
 
inherit
 
the
 
abilities
 
of
 
either
 
parent.
 
 
There
 
are
 
eight
 
ancestries
 
presented
 
within
 
the
 
core
 
ruleset:
 
humans,
 
elves,
 
charmes,
 
svartals,
 
tritons,
 
starfolk,
 
dragons,
 
and
 
daemons.
 
 
Each
 
ancestry
 
provides
 
you
 
with
 
two
 
unique
 
abilities.
 
These
 
represent
 
an
 
ancestry’s
 
distinctive
 
traits
 
-
 
whether
 
they
 
be
 
physical,
 
mental,
 
or
 
cultural.
 
Like
 
style
 
abilities,
 
ancestry
 
abilities
 
must
 
be
 
equipped
 
with
 
your
 
Ability
 
Slots
 
if
 
you
 
wish
 
to
 
take
 
advantage
 
of
 
them
 
during
 
combat
 
encounters.
 
 
Character
 
Creation
:
 
Ancestry
 
During
 
the
 
character
 
creation
 
process,
 
you
 
must
 
choose
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
ancestries.
 
If
 
you
 
decide
 
to
 
choose
 
two,
 
you
 
only
 
receive
 
the
 
first
 
listed
 
ability
 
of
 
each
 
of
 
those
 
ancestries.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
intend
 
to
 
play
 
a
 
half-elf,
 
you
 
would
 
gain
 
the
 
DDD
 
ability
 
from
 
your
 
human
 
side,
 
and
 
the
 
Elvish
 
Grace
 
ability
 
from
 
your
 
elvish

However
 
you
 
would
 
lose

at.
 
Each
 
attribute
 
starts
 
as
 
a
 
+0
 
modifier
 
value.
 
 
When
 
playing
 
a
 
card,
 
you
 
will
 
often
 
be
 
prompted
 
to
 
add
 
your
 
Might,
 
Agility,
 
or
 
Will
 
modifier
 
to
 
that
 
card’s
 
attack
 
roll
 
and
 
damage
 
result.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
+2
 
Might
 
modifier
 
and
 
play
 
a
 
card
 
that
 
says
 
you
 
deal
 
10
 
+
 
Might
 
damage,
 
you
 
would
 
deal
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
12
 
damage.
 
 
✦
 
Might
 
represents
 
your
 
physical
 
prowess,
 
vigor,
 
aggression,
 
and
 
passion.
 
✦
 
Agility
 
represents
 
your
 
natural
 
grace,
 
reflexes,
 
focus,
 
and
 
cunning.
 
✦
 
Will
 
represents
 
your
 
awareness,
 
wits,
 
self-control,
 
and
 
determination.
 
 
When
 
something
 
says
 
to
 
add
 
“any”
 
to
 
an
 
attack
 
roll
 
or
 
damage
 
result,
 
that
 
means
 
you
 
can
 
choose
 
which
 
attribute
 
to
 
use.
 
Defence
 
Your
 
defence
 
represents
 
how
 
good
 
you
 
are
 
at
 
evading
 
danger,
 
blocking
 
attacks,
 
and
 
disrupting
 
incoming
 
spells
 
with
 
countermagic.
 
Your
 
Defence
 
starts
 
with
 
a
 
value
 
of
 
10.
 
 
Whenever
 
an
 
enemy
 
attacks
 
you,
 
your
 
defence
 
value
 
acts
 
as
 
the
 
difficulty
 
threshold
 
for
 
their
 
attack
 
roll.
 
You
 
can
 
improve
 
your
 
defence
 
by
 
wearing
 
armour
 
(Pg.
 
XX),
 
or
 
by
 
actively
 
guarding
 
against
 
attacks
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
 
Character
 
Creation
:
 
Might,
 
Agility,
 
Will,
 
and
 
Defence
 
During
 
the
 
character
 
creation
 
process,
 
you
 
must
 
divide
 
8
 
points
 
as
 
you
 
choose
 
among
 
your
 
Might,
 
Agility,
 
Will,
 
and
 
Defence.
 
 
✦
 
When
 
you
 
allocate
 
a
 
point
 
to
 
an
 
attribute,
 
increase
 
its
 
value
 
by
 
+1.
 
✦
 
You
 
cannot
 
spend
 
more
 
than
 
3
 
points
 
on
 
any
 
single
 
attribute.
 
 
 
Health
 
Points
 
Your
 
health
 
points
 
represent
 
how
 
long
 
you
 
can
 
stay
 
in
 
combat.
 
You
 
start
 
with
 
50
 
max
 
health
 
points.
 
A
 
character
 
cannot
 
act
 
when
 
they
 
have
 
0
 
HP.
 
 
When
 
you
 
are
 
reduced
 
to
 
0
 
health
 
points
 
you
 
become
 
defeated.
 
This
 
immediately
 
halves
 
your
 
max
 
HP
 
until
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
combat.
 
This
 
effect
 
stacks
 
with
 
each
 
subsequent
 
defeat.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
50
 
max
 
HP,
 
but
 
are
 
defeated,
 
your
 
max
 
HP
 
becomes
 
25
 
for
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
encounter.
 
If
 
you
 
were
 
defeated
 
a
 
second
 
time
 
it
 
would
 
be
 
further
 
reduced
 
to
 
12
 
HP.
 
Armour
 
Points
 
Certain
 
types
 
of
 
armour
 
and
 
some
 
abilities
 
like
 
Machine
 
Heart
 
can
 
grant
 
armour
 
points.
 
When
 
taking
 
damage,
 
always
 
reduce
 
your
 
AP
 
before
 
your
 
health
 
points.
 
 
Armour
 
points
 
cannot
 
be
 
restored
 
with
 
healing
 
magic,
 
but
 
most
 
sources
 
of
 
armour
 
will
 
restore
 
any
 
AP
 
you
 
lost
 
at
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
the
 
next
 
round.
 
Attacks
 
that
 
deal
 
[

ignore
 
any
 
AP
 
you
 
have
 
and
 
deal
 
direct
 
damage
 
to
 
your
 
health
 
points.
 
Movement
 
Points
 
Your
 
movement
 
points
 
reflect
 
how
 
fast
 
you

You
 
start
 
with
 
6

At

Command
 
Capacity
 
Your
 
command
 
capacity
 
determines
 
how
 
many
 
minions
 
you
 
can
 
control
 
at
 
a
 
time.
 
Minions
 
are
 
NPCs
 
under
 
your
 
command
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
give
 
orders
 
to
 
during
 
your
 
turn.
 
They
 
are
 
summoned
 
by
 
certain
 
abilities
 
or
 
card
 
effects.
  
Your
 
command
 
capacity
 
starts
 
with
 
a
 
value
 
of
 
10.
 
 
Each
 
minion
 
has
 
a
 
special
 
upkeep
 
attribute
 
that
 
determines
 
how
 
much
 
of
 
your
 
command
 
capacity
 
it
 
takes
 
to
 
control
 
them
 
during
 
combat.
 
Naturally,
 
you
 
cannot
 
control
 
more
 
minions
 
than
 
your
 
CC
 
would
 
allow,

any

minion
 
that
 
you
 
wouldn’t
 
be
 
able

For

command
 
capacity
 
and
 
2
 
minions
 
each
 
with
 
an

5,
 
you
 
could
 
not

Create-a-Mage
 
Step
 
III:
 
Fighting
 
Styles
 
During
 
your
 
upbringing
 
as
 
a
 
mage,
 
you
 
are
 
taught
 
how
 
to
 
utilise
 
magic
 
in
 
battle.
 
Whether
 
you
 
were
 
tutored
 
by
 
another
 
mage,
 
read
 
through
 
tomes
 
and
 
treatises
 
on
 
battle,
 
or
 
faced
 
your
 
own
 
personal
 
trials,
 
you
 
had
 
already
 
begun
 
to
 
learn
 
many
 
established
 
fighting
 
styles.
 
 
By
 
the
 
time
 
you
 
graduate,
 
you
 
will
 
have
 
formulated
 
your
 
own
 
style
 
by
 
combining
 
aspects
 
from
 
these
 
preexisting
 
styles.
 
 
 
Fighting
 
styles
 
come
 
in
 
two
 
forms:
 
major
 
and
 
minor.
 
 
✦
 
Major
 
styles
 
grant
 
2
 
new
 
abilities,
 
and
 
8
 
unique
 
cards.
 
You
 
gain
 
2
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
two
 
cards
 
listed,
 
and
 
1
 
copy
 
of
 
each
 
other
 
card.
 
✦
 
Minor
 
styles
 
grant
 
1
 
new
 
ability,
 
and
 
4
 
unique
 
cards.
 
You
 
gain
 
2
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
card
 
listed,
 
and
 
1
 
copy
 
of
 
each
 
other
 
card.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
gain
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
Earthsteel
 
Warrior
 
major
 
style,
 
you
 
would
 
gain
 
the
 
Power
 
of
 
the
 
Earth
 
and
 
Terse
 
Technique
 
abilities,
 
2
 
copies
 
of
 
Earthsteel
 
Bash
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
Earthsteel
 
Rush
,
 
and
 
finally
 
1
 
copy
 
of
 
each
 
other
 
card
 
from
 
that
 
style’s
 
card
 
list.
 
 
Major
 
styles
 
tend
 
to
 
offer
 
a
 
complete
 
package
 
that
 
synergizes
 
well
 
with
 
itself,
 
while
 
minor
 
styles
 
are
 
meant
 
to
 
accentuate
 
the
 
way
 
you
 
fight,
 
offer
 
some
 
flexibility,
 
or
 
to
 
shore
 
up
 
your
 
weaknesses.
 
 
 
Character
 
Creation
:
 
Fighting
 
Styles
 
During
 
the
 
character
 
creation
 
process,
 
you
 
gain
 
6
 
style
 
points
 
you
 
must
 
spend.
 
It
 
costs
 
2
 
points
 
to
 
obtain
 
a
 
major
 
style,
 
and
 
1
 
point
 
to
 
obtain
 
a
 
minor
 
style.
 
 
You
 
may
 
always
 
choose
 
to
 
obtain
 
the
 
same
 
style
 
more
 
than
 
once.
 
If
 
you
 
do,
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
gain
 
extra
 
copies
 
of
 
any
 
of
 
its
 
abilities,
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
gain
 
more
 
than
 
3
 
copies
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
card,
 
any
 
spare
 
copies
 
must
 
be
 
converted
 
into
 
cards
 
from
 
the
 
Arcanist
 
Artes
.
 
 
Once
 
you
 
have
 
finished
 
choosing
 
your
 
fighting
 
styles,
 
you
 
should
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
a
 
pool
 
of
 
30
 
cards
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
deck
 
with
 
and
 
several
 
abilities
 
you
 
can
 
equip.
 
As
 
a
 
rule,
 
your
 
deck
 
cannot
 
have
 
more
 
than
 
3
 
copies
 
of
 
any
 
single
 
card
 
in
 
it,
 
and
 
cannot
 
have
 
less
 
than
 
21
 
cards
 
in
 
total.

Items
 
&
 
Artefacts
 
The
 
craftiness
 
of
 
mages
 
does
 
not
 
end
 
with
 
their
 
magical
 
powers,
 
as
 
many
 
carry
 
various
 
weapons
 
and
 
trinkets,
 
wear
 
armour,
 
and
 
wield
 
powerful
 
magical
 
artefacts
 
to
 
gain
 
an
 
edge
 
on
 
their
 
enemies.
 
 
Combat
 
items
 
are
 
divided
 
into
 
four
 
categories:
 
weapons,
 
armour,
 
trinkets,
 
and
 
artefacts.
 
A
 
full
 
list
 
of
 
items
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
three
 
categories
 
can
 
be
 
found
 
in
 
Personal
 
Equipment
 
(Pg.
 
XX),
 
while
 
a
 
list
 
of
 
available
 
artefacts
 
are
 
present
 
in
 
the
 
Arcane
 
Compendium.
 
 
Character
 
Creation
:
 
Items
 
&
 
Artefacts
 
You
 
always
 
have
 
access
 
to
 
any
 
piece
 
of
 
mundane
 
equipment
 
which
 
includes
 
weapons,
 
armour,
 
and
 
trinkets
 
detailed
 
within
 
the
 
core
 
rulebook.
 
Additionally,
 
you
 
gain
 
2
 
points
 
you
 
must
 
spend
 
to
 
obtain
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
artefacts
 
from
 
the
 
Arcane
 
Compendium.
 
Weapons
 
While
 
magic
 
is
 
quite
 
powerful
 
on
 
its
 
own,
 
mages
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
intensify
 
its
 
effects
 
by
 
channeling
 
it
 
through
 
physical
 
implements
 
such
 
as
 
staves,
 
swords,
 
bows,
 
guns,
 
and
 
so
 
on.
 
 
When
 
you
 
play
 
a
 
card
 
that
 
notes
 
a
 
weapon
 
type
 
in
 
its
 
attack
 
range
 
entry,
 
you
 
may
 
choose
 
one
 
compatible
 
weapon
 
you
 
have
 
equipped
 
and
 
channel
 
the
 
card
 
through
 
it.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
range
 
entry
 
that
 
says
 
“4
 
squares
 
or
 
Ranged
 
Weapon”
 
can
 
be
 
channeled
 
through
 
any
 
ranged
 
weapon.
 
 
By
 
channeling
 
a
 
card,
 
its
 
range
 
is
 
limited
 
to
 
the
 
channeled
 
weapon’s
 
range,

Create-a-Mage
 
Armour
 
The
 
stereotypical
 
mage
 
is
 
always
 
imagined
 
as
 
only
 
wearing
 
robes
 
and
 
a
 
pointy
 
hat.
 
This
 
image
 
is
 
at
 
odds
 
with
 
reality,
 
as
 
personal
 
protection
 
like
 
helmets,
 
coifs,
 
chainmail
 
shirts,
 
breastplates,
 
and
 
so
 
on
 
are
 
commonly
 
worn
 
by
 
mages
 
and
 
offer
 
solid
 
protection
 
even
 
against
 
magic.
 
 
When
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
wearing
 
armour,
 
you
 
may
 
only
 
have
 
one
 
piece
 
of
 
head
 
armour,
 
and
 
one
 
piece
 
of
 
body
 
armour
 
equipped
 
at
 
any
 
one
 
time.
 
Each
 
piece
 
of
 
armour
 
grants
 
a
 
bonus
 
to
 
your
 
Defence,
 
a
 
source
 
of

Artefacts
 
Throughout
 
history,
 
certain
 
objects
 
are
 
imbued
 
with
 
tremendous
 
magical
 
power
 
by
 
dint
 
of
 
their
 
historical
 
importance
 
or
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
their
 
creator.
 
Mages
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
obtain
 
ritual
 
facsimiles
 
which
 
allow
 
them
 
to
 
manifest
 
a
 
mere
 
sliver
 
of
 
the
 
original’s
 
true
 
power.
 
 
Any
 
mage
 
worth
 
their
 
salt
 
could
 
manifest
 
a
 
fragment
 
of
 
Excalibur,
 
but
 
only
 
one
 
may
 
truly
 
wield
 
the
 
legendary
 
blade.
 
 
The
 
artefacts
 
detailed
 
in
 
the
 
Arcane
 
Compendium
 
represent
 
these
 
vestigial,
 
but
 
still
 
impressive
 
copies.
 
Original
 
artefacts
 
are
 
incredibly
 
rare,
 
and
 
are
 
highly
 
prized
 
among
 
archmages
 
and
 
kings.
 
 
It
 
is
 
not
 
enough
 
to
 
own
 
artefact,
 
as
 
one
 
must
 
bond
 
their
 
soul
 
to
 
wield
 
its
 
power.
 
This
 
prevents
 
it
 
from
 
ever
 
being
 
lost
 
or
 
disarmed,
 
and
 
allows
 
the
 
mage
 
to
 
summon
 
it
 
at
 
will.
 
 
Artefacts
 
superficially
 
resemble
 
mundane
 
items,
 
with
 
popular
 
artefacts
 
being
 
weapons,
 
staves,
 
suits
 
of
 
armour,
 
and
 
other
 
battle-ready
 
equipment.
 
Unlike
 
mundane
 
items
 
however,
 
artefacts
 
can
 
be
 
equipped
 
by
 
either
 
using
 
your
 
equipment
 
slots,
 
ability
 
slots,
 
or
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
both.
 
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
an
 
artefact
 
that
 
takes
 
up
 
to
 
2
 
slots,
 
you
 
could
 
equip
 
it
 
by
 
allocating
 
1
 
equipment
 
slot
 
and
 
1
 
ability
 
slot.
 
 
When
 
you
 
equip
 
an
 
artefact,
 
you
 
automatically
 
equip
 
its
 
associated
 
artefact
 
ability.

Background
 
Your
 
mage’s
 
background
 
represents
 
their
 
unique
 
traits
 
and
 
natural
 
talents
 
beyond
 
their
 
fighting
 
skills.
 
Specifically,
 
it
 
is
 
defined
 
by
 
their
 
Aspects,
 
Circles,
 
and
 
Lores.
 
Aspects
 
A
 
mage’s
 
Aspects
 
represent
 
the
 
core
 
elements
 
of
 
who
 
they
 
are
 
and
 
what
 
they
 
are
 
capable
 
of.
 
Outside
 
of
 
combat,
 
Aspects
 
can
 
be
 
invoked
 
as
 
a
 
bonus
 
modifier
 
for
 
rolls
 
whenever
 
they
 
are
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
task
 
you
 
are

to
 
perform.
 
✦
 
If
 
the

If
 
the

If
 
the

Character
 
Creation
:
 
Aspects
 
During
 
the
 
character
 
creation
 
process,
 
you
 
must
 
write
 
in
 
2-4
 
short
 
statements
 
or
 
sentences
 
that
 
describe
 
your
 
mage’s
 
personality,
 
background,
 
talents,
 
goals,
 
and
 
any
 
other
 
important
 
elements
 
that
 
define
 
their
 
actions.
 
 
Creating
 
a
 
mage’s
 
Aspects
 
is
 
a
 
freeform
 
process
 
that
 
benefits
 
from
 
openly
 
discussing
 
your
 
ideas
 
with
 
the
 
GM.
 
This
 
helps
 
to
 
determine
 
which
 
Aspects
 
may
 
turn
 
out
 
to
 
not
 
be
 
useful
 
or
 
relevant
 
to
 
the
 
story.
 
 
Aspects
 
may
 
grant
 
you
 
special
 
narrative
 
abilities.
 
For
 
example
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
an
 
Aspect
 
called
 
“
Gloomy
 
Psychopomp
”,
 
this
 
would
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
easily
 
establish
 
your
 
mage
 
as
 
having
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
see
 
ghosts
 
and
 
speak
 
to
 
the
 
dead.
 
 
The
 
application
 
of
 
certain
 
Aspects
 
might
 
be
 
more
 
vague
 
or
 
abstract,
 
while
 
still
 
being
 
useful
 
to
 
have.
 
With
 
“
Gloomy
 
Psychopomp
”,
 
the
 
“
Gloomy
”
 
part
 
could
 
represent
 
how
 
your
 
mage
 
is
 
somewhat
 
intimidating,
 
hard
 
to
 
approach,
 
and
 
difficult
 
to
 
read.
 
 
The
 
most
 
abstract
 
Aspects
 
are
 
those
 
that
 
represent
 
your
 
mage’s
 
goals
 
or
 
events
 
that
 
greatly
 
affected
 
them.
 
For
 
example,
 
“
My
 
village
 
was
 
razed
 
by
 
the
 
Empire.
”
 
could
 
grant
 
bonuses
 
on
 
rolls
 
that
 
help
 
you
 
seek
 
out,
 
intimidate,
 
and
 
punish
 
the
 
perpetrators.
 
As
 
another
 
example,
 
“
I
 
don’t
 
know
 
how
 
I
 
got
 
here
”
 
could
 
represent
 
someone
 
who
 
was
 
recently
 
Stranded
 
on
 
Urn,
 
allowing
 
them
 
to
 
“play
 
stupid”
 
and
 
get
 
away
 
with
 
things
 
others
 
couldn’t.

Ancestral
 
Aspects
 
Your
 
ancestry
 
may
 
impart
 
special
 
abilities
 
that
 
come
 
natural
 
to
 
your
 
kind.
 
These
 
count
 
as
 
Aspects,
 
allowing
 
you
 
to
 
gain
 
the
 
Aspect
 
bonus
 
when
 
they
 
are
 
relevant
 
to
 
solving
 
a
 
task.
 
 
Humans
 
evolved
 
as
 
persistence
 
hunters,
 
granting
 
them
 
an
 
impressive
 
amount
 
of
 
natural
 
stamina
 
and
 
endurance
 
when
 
travelling
 
long
 
distances.
 
Due
 
to
 
their
 
short
 
lifespan
 
and
 
comparatively
 
frail
 
nature,
 
humans
 
have
 
an
 
impressive
 
will
 
to
 
survive.
 
 
Elves
 
have
 
heightened
 
senses
 
and
 
are
 
particularly
 
sensitive
 
to
 
body
 
language,
 
making
 
it
 
easy
 
for
 
them
 
to
 
tell
 
truth
 
from
 
lies.
 
They
 
are
 
also
 
good
 
at
 
hiding
 
their
 
own
 
tells
 
even
 
from
 
their
 
own
 
kind,
 
making
 
them
 
incredibly
 
hard
 
to
 
read.
 
 
Charmes
 
naturally
 
produce
 
a
 
magic
 
substance
 
from
 
their
 
skin
 
called
 
ichor.
 
Whenever
 
someone
 
touches
 
fresh
 
ichor,
 
they
 
become
 
briefly
 
enchanted
 
by
 
the
 
charme
 
it
 
came
 
from.
 
Prolonged
 
exposure
 
extends
 
the
 
duration
 
of
 
the
 
charme
 
enchantment.
 
 
Svartals
 
do
 
not
 
need
 
to
 
eat,
 
drink,
 
or
 
breathe,
 
but
 
are
 
capable
 
of
 
intentionally
 
performing
 
these
 
actions.
 
While
 
they
 
don’t
 
sleep,
 
they
 
must
 
enter
 
a
 
low-power
 
mode
 
each
 
day
 
to
 
fully
 
recharge
 
during
 
which
 
they
 
are
 
fully
 
aware
 
and
 
can
 
“wake
 
up”
 
in
 
an
 
instant.
 
Svartals
 
are
 
immune
 
to
 
radiation,
 
toxins,
 
diseases,
 
and
 
are
 
highly
 
resistant
 
to
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
ichor.
 
 
Tritons
 
are
 
fully
 
adapted
 
to
 
their
 
oceanic
 
environment.
 
On
 
land,
 
they
 
are
 
capable
 
of
 
walking
 
on
 
two
 
legs,
 
but
 
once
 
they
 
begin
 
to
 
swim
 
they
 
can
 
transform
 
their
 
lower
 
half
 
into
 
that
 
of
 
a
 
sea
 
animal
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
fish
 
or
 
seal.
 
They
 
can
 
breathe
 
underwater,
 
withstand
 
the
 
pressures
 
of
 
the
 
deep
 
sea,
 
and
 
are
 
naturally
 
adept
 
at
 
water
 
magic.
 
 
Starfolk
 
can
 
naturally
 
wield
 
gravity
 
magic
 
from
 
birth,
 
allowing
 
them
 
to
 
levitate
 
objects,
 
float
 
around,
 
or
 
make
 
things
 
heavier.
 
They
 
are
 
also
 
highly
 
resistant
 
to
 
radiation
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
extreme
 
heat
 
and
 
cold.
 
 
Dragons
 
are
 
limited
 
shapeshifters
 
with
 
a
 
basic
 
humanoid
 
shape
 
that
 
usually
 
has
 
superficially
 
draconic
 
features
 
like
 
horns,
 
patches
 
of
 
scales,
 
wings,
 
and/or
 
a
 
tail.
 
For
 
most
 
dragons,
 
their
 
true
 
form
 
is
 
roughly
 
the
 
size
 
of
 
a
 
tiger
 
with
 
a
 
wingspan
 
ranging
 
from
 
8
 
to
 
12
 
meters.
 
When
 
in
 
their
 
true
 
form,
 
they
 
may
 
fly
 
around
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
they
 
aren’t
 
stressed,
 
exhausted,
 
or
 
overburdened.
 
 
Daemons
 
are
 
full-on
 
shapeshifters
 
who
 
can
 
transform
 
into
 
anyone
 
or
 
anything
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
it
 
is
 
roughly
 
the
 
same
 
size
 
as
 
them
 
or
 
smaller.
 
They
 
are
 
also
 
capable
 
of
 
perceiving
 
strong
 
negative
 
emotions
 
in
 
others,
 
and
 
can
 
detect
 
the
 
presence
 
of
 
magic
 
by
 
its
 
scent.

A

is
 
considered
 
“favourable”
 
when
 
their

align.
 
Inversely,
 
a

considered
 
“opposed”
 
when
 
their

are
 
hostile

have
 
favourable
 
dealings
 
as
 
both
 
are
 
hostile
 
to
 
the
 
Emperor
 
and
 
his
 
court.
 
 
Your
 
Circles
 
also
 
represent
 
knowledge
 
of
 
trends,
 
phrases,
 
and
 
how
 
to
 
“talk
 
shop”
 
with
 
members
 
of
 
the
 
same
 
Circle.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
two
 
people
 
with
 
the
 
“Blacksmith
 
Guild”
 
Circle
 
who
 
just
 
met
 
would
 
easily
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
size
 
each
 
other
 
up
 
and
 
form
 
an
 
instant
 
rapport.
 
 
Character
 
Creation
:
 
Aspects
 
During
 
the
 
character
 
creation
 
process,
 
you
 
must
 
establish
 
two
 
miscellaneous
 
Circles.
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
your
 
character
 
starts
 
with
 
Allegiance
 
(Azirland),
 
and
 
Stratum
 
(the
 
Front).
 
Circle
 
of
 
Allegiance
 
The
 
Circle
 
of
 
Allegiance
 
represents
 
your
 
cultural
 
familiarity
 
within
 
a
 
certain
 
nation,
 
region,
 
enclave,
 
or
 
major
 
faction.
 
 
 
Your
 
Circle
 
of
 
Allegiance
 
also
 
reflects
 
what
 
languages
 
you
 
speak,
 
what
 
places
 
you
 
know
 
about,
 
what
 
history
 
you
 
were
 
taught,
 
and
 
what
 
laws
 
and
 
taboos
 
you
 
observe.
 
 
 
Allegiance
 
isn’t
 
an
 
assumption
 
of
 
loyalty.
 
One
 
can
 
be
 
familiar
 
with
 
where
 
they
 
were
 
raised
 
and
 
lived
 
without
 
being
 
loyal
 
to
 
it.
 
 
Example
 
Allegiances
 
Azirland,
 
the
 
Bathele
 
Empire,
 
the
 
Istrian
 
League,
 
the
 
Mertide
 
of
 
Shimmershore,
 
the
 
Moon
 
of
 
Spinel,
 
the
 
Swiftwoods,
 
the
 
United
 
States
 
of
 
America.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Circle
 
of
 
Stratum
 
The
 
Circle
 
of
 
Stratum
 
represents
 
your
 
position
 
within
 
society,
 
and
 
can
 
vary
 
greatly
 
depending
 
on
 
who
 
currently
 
rules
 
the
 
lands
 
you
 
call
 
home.
 
 
 
A
 
classic
 
example
 
of
 
Circle
 
Strata
 
is
 
the
 
feudal
 
system
 
with
 
the
 
nobility
 
on
 
top,
 
burghers
 
and
 
clergy
 
in
 
the
 
middle,
 
and
 
peasants
 
at
 
the
 
bottom.
 
 
By
 
comparison,
 
the
 
Azirlander
 
Circle
 
Strata
 
represents
 
its
 
unique
 
political
 
approach
 
as
 
a
 
communal
 
magocracy.
 
 
The
 
Front
 
This
 
Circle
 
Strata
 
represents
 
the
 
Stage
 
Magistry
 
and
 
its
 
roster
 
of
 
state-mages.
 
The
 
Front
 
is
 
the
 
means
 
in
 
which
 
Azirland
 
directs
 
and
 
exercises
 
its
 
power,
 
influence,
 
and
 
arcane
 
might
 
within
 
and
 
without
 
the
 
nation.
 
 
In
 
times
 
of
 
war,
 
the
 
state-mages
 
take
 
on
 
the
 
roles
 
of
 
generals,
 
leaders,
 
and
 
warriors.
 
In
 
times
 
of
 
peace,
 
each
 
mage
 
takes
 
on
 
their
 
own
 
vocation
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
personal
 
skills
 
and
 
interests
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
help
 
the
 
people
 
of
 
Azirland.
 
 
The
 
Center
 
This
 
Circle
 
Strata
 
represents
 
the
 
Arcane
 
Bureaucracy,
 
the
 
legion
 
of
 
civil
 
servants,
 
and
 
the
 
centralization
 
of
 
power
 
within
 
Azirland.
 
The
 
Center
 
is
 
the
 
home
 
of
 
the
 
civil
 
engineers,
 
city
 
planners,
 
resource
 
distributors,
 
logisticians,
 
and
 
local
 
magistrates
 
that
 
keep
 
Azirland
 
running.

COMBAT
 
The
 
current
 
of
 
magic
 
flows
 
the
 
strongest
 
on
 
the
 
field
 
of
 
battle.
 
It
 
is
 
here
 
where
 
steel
 
clashes,
 
sparks
 
fly,
 
smoke
 
swirls,
 
and
 
emotions
 
run
 
high
 
that
 
a
 
mage
 
is
 
truly
 
able
 
to
 
become
 
unleashed.
 
 
This
 
chapter
 
will
 
detail
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
rules
 
necessary
 
to
 
properly
 
resolve
 
combat
 
encounters.
 
The
 
core
 
mechanics
 
are
 
easy
 
to
 
learn,
 
allowing
 
you
 
to
 
play
 
without
 
constantly
 
having
 
to
 
reference
 
the
 
rules.
 
Round
 
&
 
Turn
 
Sequencing
 
Combat
 
is
 
divided
 
into
 
rounds,
 
which
 
are
 
sub-divided
 
into
 
one
 
turn
 
for
 
each
 
character
 
involved
 
in
 
the
 
combat
 
encounter.
 
During
 
a
 
character’s
 
turn,
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
take
 
actions
 
that
 
represent
 
how
 
they
 
engage
 
with
 
the
 
enemy.
 
 
Each
 
round
 
starts
 
with
 
an
 
allied
 
turn,
 
then
 
an
 
enemy
 
turn,
 
then
 
an
 
allied
 
turn,
 
with
 
the
 
pattern
 
repeating
 
until
 
one
 
side
 
has
 
taken
 
all
 
their
  
turns.
 
When
 
this
 
happens,
 
the
 
other
 
side
 
then
 
resolves
 
all
 
their
 
remaining
 
turns
 
one
 
after
 
the
 
other.
 
 
Once
 
each
 
character
 
that
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
act
 
has
 
taken
 
their
 
turn,
 
the
 
current
 
round
 
ends,
 
and
 
a
 
new
 
round
 
begins.

any

or
 
allied
 
NPC
 
who
 
hasn’t
 
taken
 
their
 
turn
 
yet
 
may
 
request
 
the
 
turn
 
slot
 
by
 
consulting
 
with
 
their
 
fellow
 
players.
 
If
 
everyone
 
is
 
in
 
agreement,
 
that
 
character
 
then
 
takes
 
their
 
turn.
 
Allied

At
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
an

the
 
Gamemaster
 
elects
 
3
 
Grunt,
 
2
 
Regular,
 
or
 
1
 
Elite,
 
Miniboss,
 
or
 
Boss-type
 
enemies
 
that
 
haven’t
 
taken
 
their
 
turn,
 
and
 
then
 
resolves
 
their
 
turn.
 
 
If
 
you
 
as
 
a
 
GM
 
are
 
finding
 
it
 
difficult
 
to
 
use
 
enemy
 
units
 
effectively,
 
refer
 
to
 
their
 
combat
 
behaviour
 
entry.
 
Draw
 
Step
 
At
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
each
 
round,
 
before
 
the
 
first
 
turn,
 
each
 
character
 
with
 
a
 
deck
 
draws
 
cards
 
until
 
they
 
reach
 
their
 
maximum
 
hand
 
size.
 
 
 
Cycle
 
Step
 
Once
 
the
 
draw
 
step
 
is
 
complete,
 
each
 
character
 
with
 
a
 
deck
 
may
 
discard
 
up
 
to
 
3
 
cards
 
from
 
their
 
hand,
 
then
 
draw
 
that
 
many
 
cards
 
from
 
their
 
deck.
 
 
 
Once
 
everyone
  
is
 
finished
 
cycling
 
cards,
 
the
 
first
 
turn
 
begins.
 
Discard
 
Step
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
round,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
more
 
cards
 
in
 
your
 
hand
 
than
 
your
 
maximum
 
hand
 
size
 
would
 
allow,
 
you
 
must
 
discard
 
cards
 
until
 
you
 
reach
 
your
 
max
 
hand
 
size.
 
Turn
 
Phases
 
There
 
are
  
three
 
turn
 
phases:
 
Start,
 
Main,
 
and
 
End.
 
Each
 
phase
 
dictates
 
when
 
certain
 
effects
 
resolve,
 
or
 
when
 
actions
 
can
 
be
 
taken.
 
 
Certain
 
effects
 
will
 
specify
 
that
 
they
 
start
 
or
 
end
 
with
 
phrases
 
like
 
“
At
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
your
 
next
 
turn
”
 
or
 
“
Until
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
your
 
turn.
”.
 
These
 
sorts
 
of
 
effects
 
are
 
resolved
 
during
 
the
 
start
 
and
 
end
 
phase
 
of
 
your
 
turn
 
respectively.
 
 
After
 
the
 
Start
 
phase,
 
you
 
begin
 
your
 
Main
 
phase.
 
This
 
is
 
where
 
you
 
resolve
 
any
 
actions
 
you
 
wish
 
to
 
take
 
against
 
your
 
enemies.
 
If
 
you
 
control
 
any
 
minions,
 
they
 
also
 
take
 
their
 
turn
 
during
 
your
 
Main
 
phase.
 
Once
 
you
 
have
 
finished
 
resolving
 
all
 
the
 
actions
 
you
 
wanted
 
(or
 
were
 
able)
 
to
 
take,
 
you
 
enter
 
the
 
End
 
phase,
 
and
 
then
 
end
 
your
 
turn.
 
Interruption
 
Certain
 
effects
 
resolve
 
at
 
“interruption
 
speed”.
 
This
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
play
 
a
 
card,
 
or
 
use
 
an
 
ability
 
during
 
any
 
phase
 
of
 
any
 
character’s
 
turn.
 
You
 
may
 
also
 
choose
 
to
 
resolve
 
the
 
interrupting
 
effect
 
as
 
a
 
response
 
to
 
another
 
declared
 
action.
 
 
Abilities
 
resolve
 
at
 
interruption
 
speed
 
unless
 
they
 
have
 
[
Slow
].
 
 
Interrupting
 
effects
 
can
 
also
 
be
 
declared
 
in
 
response
 
to
 
other
 
interrupting
 
effects.
 
The
 
relative
 
order
 
of
 
these
 
effects
 
is
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
the
 
“stack”.
 
Once
 
the
 
last
 
interrupting
 
effect
 
has
 
been
 
declared,
 
each
 
effect
 
on
 
the
 
stack
 
is
 
resolved
 
in
 
reverse
 
order.
 
 
If
 
an
 
interrupted
 
effect
 
would
 
be
 
unable
 
to
 
resolve
 
due
 
to
 
another
 
effect
 
on
 
the
 
stack,
 
that
 
effect
 
fails
 
to
 
resolve.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
bandit
 
swings
 
a
 
sword
 
at
 
Mida.
 
In
 
response,
 
she
 
plays
 
a
 
cantrip
 
spell
 
that
 
allows
 
her
 
to
 
shift
 
1
 
square
 
at
 
interruption
 
speed.
 
Now
 
that
 
she
 
is
 
2
 
squares
 
away
 
from
 
the
 
bandit,
 
and
 
a
 
sword
 
only
 
has
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
1
 
square,
 
that
 
bandit’s
 
attack
 
automatically
 
fails
 
to
 
resolve.

Combat
 
Actions
 
Actions
 
represent
 
what
 
your
 
character
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
do
 
during
 
their
 
turn.
 
The
 
description
 
of
 
each
 
action
 
notes
 
how
 
fast
 
it
 
resolves,
 
either
 
being
 
an
 
interrupting
 
or
 
slow
 
effect.
 
 
 
Slow
 
effects
 
must
 
be
 
fully
 
resolved
 
before
 
another
 
slow
 
action
 
can
 
be
 
taken.
 
Effects
 
with
 
[
Movement
]
 
resolve
 
as
 
slow
 
actions
 
except
 
when
 
you
 
are
 
Moving
 
&
 
Casting
.
 
Cast
 
Action
 
Once
 
during
 
your
 
turn
 
you
 
may
 
take
 
the
 
Cast
 
action,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
slow
 
action
 
that
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
form
 
a
 
spell
 
combo.
 
 
 
To
 
do
 
this,
 
take
 
cards
 
from
 
your
 
hand
 
and
 
place
 
them
 
onto
 
your
 
gameboard
 
in
 
left-to-right
 
order,
 
making
 
sure
 
to
 
maintain
 
card
 
edge
 
compatibility
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
 
Once
 
assembled,
 
play
 
each
 
card
 
in
 
the
 
combo
 
one
 
at
 
a
 
time
 
starting
 
with
 
the
 
left-most
 
card.
 
After
 
the
 
combo
 
ends,
 
each
 
card
 
played
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
it
 
is
 
put
 
into
 
your
 
Void
 
pile.
 
Combo
 
Limit
 
When
 
forming
 
a
 
combo,
 
you
 
may
 
only
 
play
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
cards
 
equal
 
to,
 
or
 
less
 
than
 
your
 
combo
 
limit.
 
Each
 
player
 
starts
 
with
 
a
 
combo
 
limit
 
of
 
5.
 
You
 
can
 
temporarily
 
increase
 
your
 
combo
 
limit
 
by
 
exploiting
 
Haste
 
counters
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
Moving
 
&
 
Casting
 
Mages
 
can
 
rarely
 
afford
 
to
 
stand
 
still
 
when
 
casting,
 
and
 
as
 
such
 
are
 
trained
 
to
 
move
 
quickly
 
while
 
spellslinging.
 
 
 
When
 
resolving
 
a
 
combo,
 
after
 
you
 
play
 
a
 
card,
 
you
 
may
 
resolve
 
any
 
ability
 
effects
 
with
 
[
Movement
]
 
at
 
interruption
 
speed
 
before
 
you
 
play
 
the
 
next
 
card
 
in
 
the
 
combo.
 
 
 
For
 
example,
 
once
 
you
 
finish
 
playing
 
a
 
card,
 
you
 
could
 
invoke
 
the
 
Run
 
ability
 
four
 
times
 
in
 
a
 
row
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
move
 
4
 
squares,
 
then
 
continue
 
with
 
the
 
next
 
card
 
in
 
your
 
combo.
 
Cantrip
 
Action
 
The
 
Cantrip
 
action
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
play
 
a
 
card
 
without
 
having
 
to
 
form
 
a
 
combo.
 
You
 
can
 
take
 
any
 
number
 
of
 
Cantrip
 
actions
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
have
 
valid
 
cards
 
to
 
play.
 
 
Cards
 
with
 
[
Cantrip
]
 
resolve
 
as
 
a
 
slow
 
action
 
and
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
played
 
during
 
your
 
turn,
 
while
 
cards
 
with
 
[
Trick
]
 
resolve
 
at
 
interruption
 
speed.
 
You
 
cannot
 
play
 
a
 
card
 
as
 
a
 
cantrip
 
without
 
either
 
of
 
these
 
keywords.
 
 
 
Illuminate
 
Action
 
Illumination
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
recharge
 
your
 
magical
 
strength
 
by
 
drawing
 
mana
 
from
 
your
 
surroundings
 
and
 
discharging
 
Void
 
energy
 
you
 
accumulated
 
by
 
casting
 
spells.
 
 
Once
 
during
 
your
 
turn,
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
are
 
Fading
 
(Pg.XX),
 
you
 
may
 
Illuminate
 
as
 
a
 
slow
 
action.
 
To
 
do
 
this,
 
shuffle
 
all
 
the
 
cards
 
in
 
your
 
Void
 
pile
 
back
 
into
 
your
 
deck.
 
 
You
 
are
 
considered
 
to
 
be
 
“Fading”
 
when
 
half
 
or
 
more
 
of
 
your
 
deck
 
is
 
contained
 
within
 
your
 
Void
 
pile.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
21
 
card
 
deck,
 
you
 
begin
 
to
 
Fade
 
whenever
 
there
 
are
 
10
 
or
 
more
 
cards
 
in
 
your
 
Void
 
pile.
 
Invoke
 
Action
 
Invocation
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
use
 
one
 
of
 
your
 
equipped
 
active
 
abilities.
 
You
 
may
 
take
 
any
 
number
 
of
 
Invoke
 
actions
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
valid
 
ability
 
to
 
use.
 
 
 
Unless
 
the
 
ability
 
has
 
[
Movement
]
 
or
 
[
Slow
],
 
its
 
effect(s)
 
resolve
 
at
 
interruption
 
speed.
 
 
If
 
you
 
cannot
 
afford

Fix
 
Action
 
Fixing
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
expend
 
a
 
card
 
or
 
Strike
 
token
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
accuracy
 
of
 
your
 
attacks.
 
You
 
can
 
take
 
any
 
number
 
of
 
Fix
 
actions
 
each
 
turn.
 
 
To
 
fix
 
a
 
card,
 
discard
 
a
 
single
 
card
 
or
 
spend
 
a
 
single
 
Strike

before
 
or
 
after
 
making
 
an

Combat
 
Guard
 
Action
 
Guarding
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
expend
 
a
 
single
 
card
 
or
 
Guard
 
token
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
protect
 
yourself
 
against
 
an
 
incoming
 
attack.
 
You
 
may
 
take
 
any
 
number
 
of
 
Guard
 
actions
 
each
 
turn,
 
but
 
only
 
once
 
per
 
attack.
 
 
To
 
guard,
 
discard
 
a
 
single
 
card
 
or
 
spend
 
a
 
single
 
Guard
 
token
 
when
 
you
 
are
 
targeted
 
by
 
an
 
attack.
 
If
 
you
 
do,
 
increase
 
your
 
Defence
 
against
 
that
 
attack
 
by
 
an
 
amount
 
equal
 
to
 
the
 
discarded
 
card’s
 
or
 
spent
 
token’s
 
Guard
 
value
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
 
Whenever
 
you
 
successfully
 
Guard
 
against
 
an
 
attack,
 
you
 
parry
 
it
 
which
 
is
 
used
 
by
 
some
 
cards
 
and
 
abilities
 
to
 
make
 
powerful
 
counterattacks.
 
Protect
 
Action
 
Protecting
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
intercept
 
an
 
attack
 
on
 
behalf
 
of
 
an
 
ally.
 
You
 
may
 
take
 
any
 
number
 
of
 
Protect
 
actions
 
each
 
turn,
 
but
 
only
 
once
 
per
 
attack.
 
 
 
Additionally,
 
you
 
may
 
only
 
take
 
the
 
Protect
 
action
 
by
 
expending
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
[
Protect/X
]
 
or
 
by
 
spending
 
a
 
Protect
 
token,
 
and
 
only
 
once
 
per
 
attack.
 
You
 
can
 
only
 
Protect
 
allies
 
who
 
haven’t
 
guarded
 
against
 
the
 
incoming
 
attack.
 
 
You
 
may
 
always
 
target
 
yourself
 
with
 
a
 
Protect
 
action.
 
 
To
 
protect,
 
resolve
 
a
 
Guard
 
action
 
on
 
behalf
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
ally
 
within
 
X
 
squares
 
where
 
X
 
is
 
the
 
Protect
 
value
 
of
 
the
 
discarded
 
card
 
or
 
spent
 
token.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
[
Protect/2
]
 
can
 
only
 
protect
 
allies
 
within
 
2
 
squares
 
of
 
you.
 
 
When
 
compared
 
to
 
Guard
 
tokens,
 
Protection
 
tokens
 
are
 
presented
 
with
 
a
 
different
 
template
 
that
 
has
 
both
 
an
 
X
 
value
 
and
 
a
 
Y
 
value
 
i.e.
 
[
Protect/2/10
].
 
 
 
The
 
X
 
value
 
denotes
 
range,
 
while
 
the
 
Y
 
value
 
denotes
 
the
 
Guard
 
value
 
of
 
that
 
token.
 
So
 
a
 
token
 
with
 
[
Protect/2/10
]
 
can
 
protect
 
an
 
ally
 
up
 
to
 
2
 
squares
 
away
 
for
 
+10
 
Defence.
 
Cleanse
 
Action
 
Cleansing
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
channel
 
healing
 
magic
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
remove
 
negative
 
status
 
effects.
 
You
 
may
 
also
 
choose
 
to
 
cleanse
 
positive
 
status
 
effects
 
if
 
necessary.
 
 
To
 
cleanse,
 
discard
 
a
 
card
 
or
 
spend
 
a
 
Guard
 
or
 
Protect
 
token.
 
If
 
you
 
do,
 
remove
 
1-5
 
status
 
counters
 
that
 
you
 
currently
 
have.
 
 
 
Command
 
Action
 
By
 
channeling
 
magic
 
into
 
your
 
loyal
 
minions,
 
you
 
can
 
impart
 
complex
 
orders
 
with
 
just
 
a
 
glance
 
or
 
gesture.
 
You
 
may
 
take
 
any
 
number
 
of
 
Command
 
actions
 
each
 
turn.
 
 
Commanding
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
pay
 
a
 
minions
 
command
 
cost,
 
granting
 
it
 
that
 
many
 
command
 
points
 
to
 
spend.
 
Command
 
points
 
are
 
denoted
 
with
 
the

symbol
 
(
★
).
 
 
 
Once
 
a
 
minion
 
has
 
1
 
or
 
more
 
★
,
 
you
 
can
 
freely
 
spend
 
them
 
during

direct
 
them
 
to
 
take
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
actions

you
 
gain
 
a

Combat
 
Earthbound
 
&
 
Airborne
 
Whenever
 
your
 
mage’s
 
feet
 
are
 
planted
 
firmly
 
on
 
the
 
ground,
 
they
 
are
 
considered
 
earthbound.
 
Similarly,
 
whenever
 
they
 
jump
 
high,
 
glide,
 
or
 
fly,
 
they
 
are
 
considered
 
airborne.
 
 
Earthbound
 
characters
 
cannot
 
attack
 
airborne
 
enemies
 
with
 
melee
 
attacks
 
with
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
1
 
square
 
and
 
vice-versa.
 
 
If
 
you
 
channel
 
a
 
melee
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
spear,
 
you
 
could
 
hit
 
an
 
airborne
 
enemy
 
as
 
it
 
would
 
have
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
“Melee,
 
2
 
squares”.
 
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
airborne
 
characters
 
ignore
 
all
 
ground-based
 
terrain
 
effects
 
on
 
any
 
square
 
below
 
them
 
such
 
as
 
pools
 
of
 
lava
 
or
 
spike
 
pits.
 
Square
 
Occupancy
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
each
 
character
 
and
 
object
 
only
 
occupies
 
a
 
single
 
square
 
on
 
the
 
battlefield.
 
Each
 
square
 
is
 
roughly
 
1.5m
 
(or
 
roughly
 
5
 
feet)
 
long
 
and
 
wide.
 
 
 
An
 
earthbound
 
character
 
and
 
an
 
airborne
 
character
 
can
 
both
 
occupy
 
the
 
same
 
square
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time.
 
By
 
comparison,
 
earthbound
 
characters
 
treat
 
all
 
squares
 
occupied
 
by
 
other
 
earthbound
 
characters
 
as
 
impassible,
 
and
 
the
 
same
 
is
 
true
 
for
 
airborne
 
characters
 
with
 
other
 
airborne
 
characters.
 
 
If
 
an
 
airborne
 
character
 
who
 
is
 
above
 
an
 
earthbound
 
character
 
becomes
 
earthbound
 
themself,
 
they
 
must
 
land
 
on
 
the
 
nearest
 
unoccupied
 
square
 
instead.
 
If
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
tie
 
in
 
distance
 
between
 
two
 
or
 
more
 
unoccupied
 
squares,
 
they
 
may
 
choose
 
which
 
one
 
to
 
land
 
on.
 
 
If
 
a
 
character
 
occupies
 
two
 
or
 
more
 
squares
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
they
 
may
 
choose
 
any
 
square
 
they
 
occupy
 
as
 
the
 
source
 
for
 
attacks
 
and
 
effects.
 
Similarly,
 
when
 
attacking
 
an
 
enemy
 
that
 
occupies
 
multiple
 
squares,
 
each
 
square
 
they
 
occupy
 
is
 
treated
 
as
 
a
 
valid
 
target.
 
Shifting
 
Shifting
 
is
 
the
 
most
 
common
 
method
 
of
 
forcibly
 
moving
 
a
 
character.
 
To
 
shift
 
an
 
enemy,
 
move
 
then
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
squares
 
stated
 
by
 
the
 
shifting
 
effect.
 
 
When
 
you
 
shift
 
an
 
ally
 
(which
 
includes
 
yourself),
 
that
 
ally
 
treats
 
all
 
squares
 
occupied
 
by
 
other
 
characters
 
and
 
objects
 
as
 
passable
 
terrain.
 
They
 
still
 
cannot
 
end
 
this
 
movement
 
on
 
an
 
already-occupied
 
square
 
however.
 
 
 
Pushing
 
&
 
Pulling
 
Whenever
 
an
 
effect
 
says
 
to
 
“push”
 
a
 
character,
 
that
 
means
 
you
 
must
 
shift
 
them
 
in
 
such
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
each
 
square
 
of
 
movement
 
is
 
one
 
further
 
away
 
from
 
you
 
than
 
the
 
last.
 
The
 
inverse
 
is
 
true
 
when
 
an
 
effect
 
says
 
to
 
“pull”
 
a
 
character.
 
Bashing
 
When
 
a
 
character
 
is
 
forcibly
 
moved
 
into
 
a
 
square
 
that
 
is
 
impassible
 
such
 
as
 
rocks,
 
tree
 
trunks,
 
or
 
another
 
character,
 
they
 
bash
 
into
 
whatever
 
is
 
currently
 
occupying
 
that
 
square.
 
 
Whenever
 
a
 
character
 
bashes
 
into
 
something,
 
any
 
forced
 
movement
 
effect
 
they
 
are
 
being
 
subjected
 
to
 
immediately
 
ends.
 
Characters
 
may
 
also
 
intentionally
 
move
 
and
 
shift
 
into
 
an
 
occupied
 
square
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
bash
 
into
 
whatever
 
is
 
on
 
it.
 
 
Bashing
 
has
 
no
 
other
 
inherent
 
properties,
 
but
 
does
 
act
 
as
 
a
 
trigger
 
to
 
activate
 
certain
 
abilities
 
and
 
card
 
effects.
 
 
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
Earthsteel
 
Bash
 
card
 
deals
 
additional
 
damage
 
if
 
you
 
push
 
an
 
enemy
 
and
 
cause
 
them
 
to
 
bash
 
into
 
something.
 
 
Carrying
 
Carrying
 
is
 
a
 
special
 
form
 
of
 
shifting
 
that
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
bullrush
 
an
 
enemy.
 
You
 
and
 
the
 
carried
 
character
 
shift
 
the
 
same
 
number
 
of
 
squares
 
in
 
the
 
same
 
direction.
 
You
 
can
 
only
 
carry
 
an
 
enemy
 
when
 
you
 
are
 
adjacent
 
to
 
them.
 
 
 
If
 
you
 
or
 
the
 
carried
 
character
 
bash,
 
both
 
of
 
you
 
stop
 
moving.
 
Effects
 
that
 
allow
 
you
 
to
 
carry
 
an
 
enemy
 
usually
 
have
 
a
 
bashing
 
effect.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
Shatterskull
 
Bullrush
 
lets
 
you
 
carry
 
an
 
enemy
 
and
 
slam
 
them
 
into
 
other
 
enemies
 
and
 
terrain.
 
Teleportation
 
Teleportation
 
is
 
a
 
special
 
form
 
of
 
shifting
 
that
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
move
 
from
 
one
 
square
 
to
 
another
 
in
 
a
 
straight
 
line
 
while
 
ignoring
 
any
 
terrain
 
in
 
between
 
those
 
positions
 
as
 
if
 
you
 
never
 
entered
 
them.
 
Teleportation
 
ignores
 
line
 
of
 
sight.
 
 
A
 
special
 
property
 
of
 
teleportation
 
is
 
that
 
it
 
conserves
 
arcanokinetic
 
momentum.
 
In
 
short,
 
this
 
means
 
that
 
every
 
square
 
you
 
skipped
 
past
 
while
 
teleporting
 
still
 
counts
 
as
 
moving
 
that
 
many
 
squares.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
teleport
 
10
 
squares
 
away,
 
it
 
counts
 
as
 
if
 
you
 
shifted
 
10
 
squares
 
as
 
well.

Combat
 
The
 
Deck
 
Each
 
mage
 
uses
 
a
 
deck
 
to
 
represent
 
what
 
magic
 
they
 
are
 
capable
 
of.
 
Each
 
deck
 
must
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
21
 
cards
 
in
 
it,
 
and
 
cannot
 
have
 
more
 
than
 
3
 
copies
 
of
 
the
 
same

At
 
the

combat,
 
you
 
must
 
shuffle
 
your
 
deck
 
and
 
then
 
place
 
it
 
face-down
 
onto
 
your
 
deck
 
zone.
 
It
 
remains
 
face-down
 
for
 
the
 
remainder
 
of

You
 
cannot

When
 
an

take
 
that

you
 
are
 
forced
 
to
 
mill
 
when
 
your
 
deck
 
is
 
empty,
 
the
 
milling
 
effect
 
does
 
nothing,
 
but
 
still
 
resolves
 
as
 
if
 
it
 
were
 
successful.
 
The
 
Hand
 
Each
 
mage
 
has
 
a
 
maximum
 
hand
 
size
 
of
 
seven
 
cards.
 
Your
 
hand
 
is
 
always
 
visible
 
to
 
everyone
 
else
 
who
 
is
 
playing,
 
including
 
your
 
Gamemaster.
 
 
During
 
the
 
draw
 
step
 
at
 
the
 
start
 
of
 
each
 
round,
 
draw
 
cards
 
until
 
you
 
reach
 
your
 
maximum
 
hand
 
size.
 
During
 
the
 
discard
 
step
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
round,
 
discard
 
any
 
excess
 
cards
 
until
 
you
 
reach
 
your
 
maximum
 
hand
 
size.
 
Discarding
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
instructs
 
you
 
to
 
discard
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
cards,
 
take
 
that
 
many
 
cards
 
from
 
your
 
hand
 
and
 
put
 
them
 
into
 
your
 
Void
 
pile.
 
If
 
you
 
are
 
forced
 
to
 
discard
 
when
 
your
 
hand
 
is
 
empty,
 
the
 
discarding
 
effect
 
does
 
nothing,
 
but
 
still
 
resolves
 
as
 
if
 
it
 
were
 
successful.
 
The
 
Void
 
The
 
soul
 
of
 
each
 
mage
 
has
 
an
 
intrinsic
 
connection
 
to
 
the
 
endless
 
dark
 
Void,
 
a
 
vast
 
emptiness
 
that
 
lies
 
beyond
 
the
 
boundaries
 
of
 
reality.
 
When
 
someone
 
uses
 
magic,
 
they
 
begin
 
to
 
physically
 
and
 
spiritually
 
separate
 
with
 
reality
 
and
 
open
 
their
 
heart
 
for
 
their
 
inner
 
darkness
 
to
 
bloom.
 
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
mages
 
are
 
taught
 
at
 
a
 
young
 
age
 
to
 
meditate
 
through
 
the
 
act
 
of
 
Illumination
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
to
 
discharge
 
any
 
Void
 
energy
 
they
 
absorbed.
 
 
During
 
combat,
 
your
 
Void
 
pile
 
is
 
the
 
zone
 
where
 
you
 
put
 
any
 
characters
 
you
 
play,
 
mill,
 
or
 
discard.
 
Your
 
Void
 
pule
 
is
 
always
 
face-up
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
freely
 
searched
 
at
 
any
 
time.
 
 
 
Soul
 
States
 
The
 
heart
 
and
 
soul
 
of
 
every
 
mage
 
constantly
 
shifts
 
from
 
light
 
to
 
darkness.
 
These
 
changes
 
in
 
one’s
 
soul
 
state
 
can
 
affect
 
how
 
they
 
wield
 
magic
 
in
 
battle,
 
acting
 
as
 
a
 
trigger
 
for
 
certain
 
card
 
effects
 
and
 
abilities.
 
There
 
are
 
three
 
soul
 
states:
 
Bright
,
 
Fading
,
 
and
 
Dark
.
 
Bright
 
When
 
a
 
mage’s
 
soul
 
state
 
is
 
bright,
 
their
 
connection
 
to
 
reality
 
is
 
at
 
its
 
strongest.
 
As
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
aren’t
 
Fading,
 
you
 
are
 
considered
 
to
 
be
 
Bright.
 
Brightness
 
is
 
associated
 
with
 
clarity,
 
focus,
 
and
 
safety,
 
relying
 
on
 
constant
 
Illumination
 
to
 
keep
 
one's
 
soul
 
clean
 
of
 
Void
 
taint.
 
 
The
 
Starseeker
 
Spellsword
 
fighting
 
style
 
is
 
at
 
its
 
strongest
 
when
 
a
 
practitioner
 
has
 
a
 
Bright
 
soul
 
state.
 
This
 
grants
 
them
 
powerful
 
foresight,
 
and
 
can
 
even
 
allow
 
them
 
to
 
bend
 
fate
 
itself.
 
Fading
 
When
 
a
 
mage’s
 
soul
 
begins
 
to
 
wane,
 
they
 
begin
 
to
 
Fade.
 
You
 
are
 
considered
 
to
 
be
 
Fading
 
whenever
 
half
 
or
 
more
 
of
 
your
 
deck
 
is
 
currently
 
contained
 
in
 
your
 
Void
 
pile.
 
 
Fading
 
is
 
associated
 
with
 
ambiguity,
 
adaptability,
 
and
 
trickery,
 
with
 
most
 
styles
 
that
 
benefit
 
from
 
Fading
 
trying
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
careful
 
balance
 
between
 
light
 
and
 
darkness.
 
 
The
 
Thundercrash
 
Trickster
 
style
 
is
 
at
 
its
 
strongest
 
when
 
a
 
practitioner
 
carefully
 
dances
 
on
 
a
 
knife’s
 
edge.
 
When
 
balance
 
is
 
achieved,
 
they
 
can
 
cast
 
spells
 
with
 
supernatural
 
speed.
 
Dark
 
When
 
a
 
mage
 
fully
 
succumbs
 
to
 
their
 
inner
 
darkness,
 
they
 
enter
 
a
 
Dark
 
soul
 
state.
 
You
 
are
 
considered
 
to
 
be
 
Dark
 
for
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
there
 
are
 
no
 
cards
 
in
 
your
 
deck.
 
 
Darkness
 
is
 
associated
 
with
 
recklessness,
 
bargains,
 
and
 
twisting
 
the
 
rules.
 
Styles
 
that
 
benefit
 
from
 
being
 
Dark
 
usually
 
grant
 
methods
 
to
 
play
 
cards
 
straight
 
from
 
your
 
Void
 
pile,
 
but
 
such
 
power
 
doesn’t
 
come
 
without
 
a
 
price
 
of
 
which
 
the
 
most
 
common
 
is
 
paying
 
one’s
 
own
 
Health
 
Points.
 
 
The
 
PLACEHOLDER
 
style
 
is
 
at
 
its
 
strongest
 
when
 
PLACEHOLDER.

SPELL
 
CARDS
 
This
 
section
 
breaks
 
down
 
the
 
basic
 
elements
 
of
 
each
 
card
 
you
 
come
 
across.
 
Each
 
card
 
represents
 
a
 
magic
 
spell,
 
and
 
in
 
an
 
abstract
 
sense
 
it
 
also
 
reflects
 
the
 
difficulty
 
in
 
consistently
 
casting
 
spells.
 
This
 
is
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
inherently
 
chaotic
 
nature
 
of
 
magic,
 
whose
 
sporadic
 
nature
 
must
 
be
 
wrangled
 
by
 
mage
 
to
 
achieve
 
any
 
sort
 
of
 
practical
 
usage.
 
 
In
 
other
 
words,
 
your
 
deck
 
represents
 
all
 
the
 
forms
 
of
 
magic
 
you
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
wield,
 
while
 
the
 
cards
 
in
 
your
 
hand
 
represent
 
what
 
spells
 
you
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
effectively
 
conjure.
 
As
 
you
 
play,
 
draw,
 
and
 
discard
 
cards,
 
the
 
ebb
 
and
 
flow
 
of
 
mana
 
dictates
 
what
 
new
 
spells
 
you
 
have
 
available.
 
 
Paired
 
with
 
this
 
core
 
rulebook
 
is
 
the
 
Arcane
 
Compendium,
 
Vol.
 
1
,
 
a
 
book
 
that
 
extensively
 
details
 
200
 
different
 
spells
 
divided
 
into
 
15
 
major
 
styles,
 
15
 
minor
 
styles,
 
and
 
countless
 
Arcanist
 
Artes.
 
 
 
While
 
each
 
of
 
these
 
cards
 
and
 
styles
 
has
 
their
 
own
 
default
 
flavour
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
Swiftwood
 
Sentinel
 
and
 
its
 
approach
 
to
 
magical
 
archery,
 
you
 
are
 
also
 
free
 
to
 
reinterpret
 
them
 
in
 
any
 
way
 
that
 
suits
 
your
 
mage.
 
 
 
For
 
example,
 
you
 
might
 
instead
 
reflavour
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
magical
 
musketeer,
 
or
 
as
 
a
 
druid
 
that
 
fires
 
magic
 
thorns
 
at
 
enemies.
 
 
 
Each
 
spell
 
card
 
has
 
eleven
 
important
 
elements:
 
its
 
(1)
 
name,
 
(2)
 
requirements,
 
(3)
 
elements,
 
(4)
 
main
 
colour,
 
(5a,
 
5b)
 
edge
 
colours,
 
(6)
 
Strike
 
value,
 
(7)
 
Guard
 
value,
 
(8)
 
range
 
entry,
 
(9)
 
attack
 
entry,
 
(10)
 
damage
 
entry,
 
and
 
(11)
 
effect
 
entry.
 
There
 
is
 
also
 
the
 
(12)
 
flavour
 
text
 
entry
 
and
 
(13)
 
archival
 
entry.
 
 
 
 
(1)
 
Card
 
Name
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
formal
 
name
 
given
 
to
 
the
 
spell
 
within
 
the
 
fighting
 
style
 
it
 
belongs
 
to.
 
You
 
can
 
only
 
have
 
up
 
to
 
3
 
cards
 
with
 
the
 
same
 
name
 
in
 
your
 
deck
 
at
 
any
 
one
 
time.
 
(2)
 
Requirements
 
These
 
determine
 
the
 
conditions
 
you
 
must
 
meet
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
add
 
this
 
card
 
to
 
a
 
combo.
 
Most
 
cards
 
have
 
no
 
requirements
 
to
 
cast,
 
and
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
will
 
not
 
show
 
the
 
white
 
requirements
 
banner
 
above
 
the
 
name
 
of
 
the
 
card.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
with
 
Daemonic
 
Rift
,
 
you
 
have
 
to
 
play
 
at
 
least
 
two
 
other
 
cards
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
add
 
it
 
to
 
your
 
combo.
 
(3)
 
Elements
 
Each
 
spell
 
consists
 
of
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
elements
 
which
 
categorizes
 
how
 
it
 
might
 
synergize
 
with
 
effects
 
that
 
benefit
 
from
 
specific
 
elements.
 
Elements
 
have
 
no
 
intrinsic
 
effects,
 
but
 
are
 
used
 
as
 
triggers
 
for
 
card
 
effects
 
and
 
abilities.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
with
 
the
 
Ritual
 
Maintenance
 
ability,
 
you
 
can
 
discard
 
a
 
Metal-type
 
card
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
heal
 
yourself
 
while
 
downed.
 
 
Each
 
spell
 
always
 
has
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
basic
 
element:
 
either
 
Physical
 
or
 
Magical.
 
Physical
 
spells
 
tend
 
to
 
deal
 
with
 
creating,
 
enhancing,
 
or
 
manipulating
 
matter,
 
while
 
magical
 
spells
 
conjure
 
or
 
manipulate
 
unnatural
 
phenomena.
 
 
Common
 
nonbasic
 
elements
 
include
 
Fire,
 
Water,
 
Shock,
 
Wind,
 
Stone,
 
Flora,
 
Bestial,
 
Sound,
 
Metal,
 
Toxic,
 
Ice,
 
Mind,
 
Body,
 
Spirit,
 
Cosmic,
 
Void,
 
Dark,
 
and
 
Light.
 
(4)
 
Main
 
Colour
 
Each
 
card
 
has
 
one
 
of
 
three
 
colours:
 
red,
 
green,
 
and
 
blue.
 
A
 
card’s
 
main
 
colour
 
is
 
visible
 
behind
 
the
 
central
 
elements
 
of
 
the
 
card
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
name
 
and
 
range
 
entry.
 
A
 
card’s
 
colour
 
can
 
be
 
important
 
as
 
a
 
trigger
 
for
 
card
 
effects
 
and
 
abilities.
 
 
It
 
should
 
be
 
noted
 
that
 
a
 
card’s
 
colour
 
has
 
no
 
direct
 
relation
 
to
 
its
 
edge
 
colours
 
i.e.
 
a
 
blue
 
card
 
with
 
two
 
red
 
edges
 
still
 
only
 
counts
 
as
 
a
 
blue
 
card.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
with
 
Daemonic
 
Rift
,
 
its
 
main
 
colour
 
is
 
red.

Edge
 
Colours
 
The
 
edges
 
on
 
the
 
left
 
and
 
right
 
side
 
of
 
each
 
card
 
are
 
important
 
when
 
forming
 
a
 
combo.
 
This
 
is
 
because
 
each
 
edge
 
must
 
match
 
colours
 
with
 
the
 
edge
 
of
 
the
 
next
 
card
 
it
 
is
 
connected
 
to.
 
Gold
 
edges
 
count
 
as
 
any
 
colour
 
the
 
caster
 
wants.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
left
 
red
 
edge
 
could
 
only
 
be
 
placed
 
after
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
red
 
or
 
gold
 
right
 
edge.
 
Dual
 
Edges
 
Some
 
cards
 
have
 
edges
 
with
 
two
 
colours
 
which
 
can
 
connect
 
to
 
any
 
other
 
edge
 
that
 
shares
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
of
 
those
 
colours.
 
Black
 
Edges
 
Black
 
edges
 
cannot
 
connect
 
to
 
any
 
other
 
card.
 
There
 
are
 
three
 
types
 
of
 
cards
 
with
 
black
 
edges:
 
starters,
 
finishers,
 
and
 
dedicated
 
cantrips.
 
✦
 
A
 
starter
 
is
 
any
 
card
 
whose
 
left
 
edge
 
is
 
black.
 
Like
 
their
 
name
 
implies,
 
starter
 
cards
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
played
 
as
 
the
 
first
 
card
 
in
 
a
 
combo.
 
✦
 
A
 
finisher
 
is
 
any
 
card
 
whose
 
right
 
edge
 
is
 
black.
 
Similar
 
to
 
starters,
 
finisher
 
cards
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
played
 
as
 
the
 
last
 
card
 
in
 
a
 
combo.
 
✦
 
A
 
dedicated
 
cantrip
 
is
 
any
 
card
 
where
 
both
 
its
 
left
 
and
 
right
 
edges
 
are
 
black,
 
preventing
 
it
 
from
 
being
 
added
 
to
 
any
 
combo.
 
Dedicated
 
cantrips
 
always
 
have
 
[
Cantrip
]
 
or
 
[
Trick
].
 
 
An
 
example
 
of
 
a
 
valid
 
four-card
 
combo.
 
The
 
colours
 
of
 
the
 
arrows
 
show
 
which
 
of
 
the
 
colours
 
connects
 
to
 
the
 
next
 
card
 
in
 
the
 
combo.
 
Standard
 
&
 
Nonstandard
 
Cards
 
Standard
 
cards
 
are
 
any
 
cards
 
with
 
two
 
coloured
 
edges,
 
while
 
nonstandard
 
cards
 
are
 
any
 
card
 
with
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
black
 
edge.
 
 
Certain
 
card
 
effects
 
and
 
abilities
 
care
 
whether
 
or
 
not
 
a
 
card
 
is
 
standard
 
or
 
nonstandard
 
such
 
as
 
Boundary
 
of
 
Logic
,
 
the
 
ability
 
associated
 
with
 
the
 
Staff
 
of
 
Liminality
 
artefact.
 
(6)
 
Strike
 
Value
 
When
 
you
 
take
 
a
 
Fix
 
action
 
(pg.
 
XX),
 
you
 
change
 
the
 
natural
 
result
 
of
 
a
 
single
 
attack
 
roll
 
or
 
each
 
result
 
of
 
multi-attack
 
to
 
a
 
value
 
equal
 
to
 
the
 
expended
 
card
 
or
 
token’s
 
Strike
 
value.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
fix
 
a
 
multi-attack
 
against
 
three
 
targets
 
with
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
Strike
 
value
 
of
 
10,
 
each
 
of
 
its
 
attacks
 
count
 
as
 
having
 
a
 
natural
 
roll
 
result
 
of
 
10.
 
(7)
 
Guard
 
Value
 
When
 
you
 
take
 
a
 
Guard
 
action
 
or
 
Protect
 
action
 
(Pg.
 
XX),
 
you
 
increase
 
the
 
protected
 
character’s
 
Defence
 
against
 
the
 
incoming
 
attack
 
by
 
an
 
amount
 
equal
 
to
 
the
 
expended
 
card
 
or
 
token’s
 
Guard
 
value.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
10
 
Defence
 
and
 
guard
 
against
 
an
 
attack
 
by
 
discarding
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
Guard
 
value
 
of
 
5,
 
your
 
total
 
Defence
 
against
 
that
 
attack
 
would
 
be
 
15.
 
(8)
 
Range
 
Entry
 
A
 
card’s
 
range
 
entry
 
determines
 
the
 
furthest
 
distance
 
it
 
can
 
target
 
a
 
character,
 
and
 
is
 
measured
 
in
 
increments
 
of
 
1
 
square.
 
Standard
 
Ranges
 
✦
 
If
 
the
 
range
 
says
 
“
Melee
 
or...
”,
 
it
 
is
 
considered
 
a
 
melee
 
attack
 
with
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
1
 
square.
 
✦
 
If
 
the
 
range
 
is
 
only
 
measured
 
in
 
squares
 
i.e.
 
“
4
 
squares
 
or…
”,
 
it
 
is
 
considered
 
a
 
ranged
 
attack.
 
Weapon
 
Ranges
 
Most
 
cards
 
have
 
a
 
standard
 
range
 
and
 
a
 
weapon
 
range
 
i.e.
 
“
...or
 
Melee
 
Weapon
”,
 
and
 
“
...or
 
Ranged
 
Weapon
”.
 
 
Cards
 
with
 
a
 
range
 
entry
 
with
 
“
...or
 
Any
 
Weapon
”
 
can
 
be
 
channeled
 
through
 
any
 
weapon
 
you
 
have
 
equipped.
 
 
This
 
means
 
you
 
can
 
either
 
choose
 
the
 
standard
 
range,
 
or
 
channel
 
that
 
card
 
through
 
a
 
valid
 
weapon
 
and
 
use
 
its
 
range
 
instead.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
longbow
 
(which
 
has
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
8
 
squares)
 
and
 
play
 
a
 
card
 
with
 
a
 
range
 
entry
 
of
 
“4
 
squares
 
or
 
Ranged
 
Weapon”,
 
you
 
could
 
channel
 
the
 
card
 
through
 
your
 
longbow
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
attack
 
enemies
 
up
 
to
 
8
 
squares
 
away.
 
Line
 
of
 
Sight
 
Certain
 
types
 
of
 
terrain
 
can
 
prevent
 
you
 
from
 
seeing
 
enemies:
 
this
 
is
 
your
 
line
 
of
 
sight.
 
To
 
determine
 
line
 
of
 
sight,
 
draw
 
an
 
invisible
 
line
 
from
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
a
 
square
 
you
 
occupy
 
to
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
the
 
square
 
you
 
are
 
targeting.
 
 
 
If
 
the
 
line
 
crosses
 
any
 
vision-blocking
 
terrain
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
wall
 
or
 
a
 
closed
 
door,
 
your
 
line
 
of
 
sight
 
is
 
blocked
 
and
 
you
 
cannot
 
target
 
that
 
square
 
or
 
any
 
enemy
 
within
 
it.
 
 
When
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
areas
 
of
 
effect,
 
you
 
only
 
need
 
to
 
have
 
line
 
of
 
sight
 
for
 
the
 
central
 
most
 
square
 
within
 
that
 
AoE.
 
Any
 
other
 
squares
 
in
 
that
 
AoE
 
use
 
the
 
center-most
 
square
 
to
 
determine
 
line
 
of
 
sight
 
to
 
any
 
squares
 
you
 
cannot
 
see.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
fling
 
a
 
fireball
 
into
 
a
 
room,
 
it
 
could
 
still
 
hit
 
enemies
 
behind
 
the
 
wall
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
the
 
central
 
square
 
of
 
the
 
fireball
 
could
 
“see”
 
them
 
and
 
they
 
fall
 
within
 
the
 
AoE.

Spell
 
Cards
 
Area
 
of
 
Effect
 
Rather
 
than
 
target
 
a
 
specific
 
character,
 
certain
 
cards
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
place
 
an
 
area
 
of
 
effect
 
or
 
“AoE”
 
centered
 
on
 
a
 
square
 
within
 
the
 
card’s
 
range
 
and
 
apply
 
the
 
effects
 
to
 
any
 
character
 
that
 
falls
 
within
 
that
 
area.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
the
 
Oscillating
 
Fireball
 
card,
 
you
 
would
 
place
 
a
 
2×2
 
area
 
within
 
range
 
and
 
attack
 
each
 
enemy
 
within
 
it.
 
 
In
 
the
 
case
 
of
 
AoE’s
 
with
 
even
 
dimensions
 
i.e.
 
2×2,
 
4×4,
 
you
 
may
 
choose
 
which
 
one
 
of
 
those
 
squares
 
is
 
the
 
“centermost”
 
square.
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
you
 
may
 
freely
 
swap
 
the
 
length
 
and
 
width
 
dimensions
 
of
 
asymmetrical
 
AoE.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
the
 
Daemonic
 
Rift
 
card,
 
you
 
could
 
either
 
place
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
4
 
high,
 
8
 
wide
 
AoE,
 
or
 
an
 
8
 
wide,
 
4
 
high
 
AoE.
 
(9)
 
Attack
 
Entry
 
A
 
card’s
 
attack
 
entry
 
determines
 
if
 
you
 
can
 
make
 
an
 
attack
 
with
 
the
 
card,
 
and
 
whether
 
or
 
not
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
roll
 
or
 
if
 
the
 
attack
 
automatically
 
hits.
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
when
 
you
 
make
 
an
 
attack
 
roll
 
and
 
hit
 
an
 
enemy,
 
you
 
always
 
deal
 
damage
 
to
 
them.
 
✦
 
If
 
an
 
attack
 
entry
 
is
 
expressed
 
like
 
“D20
 
+
 
Might”,
 
that
 
means
 
you
 
must
 
make
 
a
 
Might
 
roll
 
vs.
 
the
 
target’s
 
Defence
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
hit
 
them.
 
✦
 
If
 
an
 
attack
 
entry
 
is
 
expressed
 
with
 
a
 
long
 
line
 
i.e.
 
“
⸻
”,
 
that
 
means
 
the
 
card
 
either
 
automatically
 
hits
 
its
 
target(s)
 
as
 
expressed
 
in
 
its
 
effect
 
entry,
 
or
 
the
 
card
 
doesn’t
 
make
 
any
 
attacks
 
at
 
all.
 
Automatic
 
Hits
 
When
 
something
 
tells
 
you
 
to
 
“automatically
 
hit”
 
an
 
enemy,
 
that
 
means
 
the
 
attack
 
roll
 
is
 
treated
 
as
 
having
 
rolled
 
a
 
natural
 
20.
 
You
 
then
 
add
 
the
 
single
 
highest
 
attribute
 
you
 
have
 
between
 
your
 
Might,
 
Agility,
 
and
 
Will.
 
All
 
other
 
attack
 
bonuses
 
still
 
apply.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
Pommel
 
Pummel
 
card
 
automatically
 
hits
 
and
 
deals
 
7
 
+
 
Might
 
damage
 
to
 
a
 
single
 
enemy.
 
If
 
you
 
have
 
5
 
Might,
 
you
 
effectively
 
get
 
a
 
final
 
result
 
of
 
25
 
on
 
the
 
attack
 
“roll”.
 
 
Automatic
 
hits
 
are
 
not
 
to
 
be
 
confused
 
with
 
effects
 
that
 
directly
 
deal
 
damage
 
to
 
a
 
target.
 
The
 
main
 
difference
 
is
 
that
 
automatic
 
hits
 
can
 
still
 
be
 
guarded
 
against,
 
while
 
direct
 
damage
 
effects
 
don’t
 
need
 
to
 
hit
 
to
 
deal
 
damage.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
Static
 
Rush
 
ability
 
has
 
the
 
effect
 
of:
 
“Whenever
 
you
 
shift,
 
afterwards
 
you
 
may
 
choose
 
a
 
single
 
enemy
 
within
 
5
 
squares
 
and
 
deal
 
5
 
Magical
 
and
 
Shock-type
 
damage
 
to
 
them.”
 
 
 
 
Multi-Attacks
 
If
 
a
 
card
 
makes
 
two
 
or
 
more
 
attacks
 
at
 
the
 
same
 
time,
 
such
 
as
 
with
 
most
 
area
 
of
 
effect
 
cards,
 
each
 
of
 
those
 
attacks
 
is
 
rolled
 
and
 
resolved
 
separately.
 
If
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
of
 
those
 
attacks
 
hits,
 
the
 
attack
 
is
 
considered
 
to
 
have
 
been
 
successfully
 
resolved.
 
 
When
 
you
 
make
 
a
 
multi-attack,
 
you
 
can
 
fix
 
each
 
of
 
those
 
attacks
 
with
 
a
 
single
 
Fix
 
action
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
the
 
Oscillating
 
Fireball
 
card
 
targeting
 
three
 
enemies,
 
you
 
could
 
fix
 
all
 
three
 
of
 
those
 
attacks
 
by
 
expending
 
only
 
a
 
single
 
card
 
or
 
Strike
 
token.
 
(10)
 
Damage
 
Entry
 
A
 
card’s
 
damage
 
entry
 
determines
 
how
 
much
 
damage
 
you
 
deal
 
to
 
an
 
enemy
 
when
 
you
 
successfully
 
hit
 
them.
 
If
 
you
 
aren’t
 
being
 
compelled
 
by
 
an
 
enemy
 
effect,
 
you
 
may
 
choose
 
to
 
reduce
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
damage
 
you
 
deal
 
by
 
any
 
amount
 
down
 
to
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
1.
 
 
Within
 
the
 
narrative,
 
magic
 
is
 
only
 
ever
 
lethal
 
when
 
a
 
mage
 
intends
 
to
 
kill
 
or
 
maim
 
their
 
target.
 
Without
 
this
 
dark
 
intention,
 
magic
 
merely
 
knocks
 
people
 
unconscious
 
with
 
no
 
permanent
 
grievous
 
wounds
 
even
 
if
 
you
 
used
 
a
 
sharp
 
blade
 
or
 
lit
 
them
 
on
 
fire.
 
(11)
 
Effect
 
Entry
 
When
 
played,
 
each
 
card
 
resolves
 
the
 
actions
 
described
 
in
 
its
 
effect
 
entry
 
without
 
deviation.
 
Because
 
card
 
effects
 
vary
 
so
 
wildly,
 
it
 
is
 
difficult
 
to
 
give
 
a
 
proper
 
explanation
 
on
 
how
 
they
 
work.
 
Generally
 
each
 
card
 
is
 
written
 
in
 
a
 
way
 
that
 
allows
 
you
 
to
 
quickly
 
understand
 
how
 
it's
 
meant
 
to
 
be
 
used.
 
 
When
 
an
 
interaction
 
with
 
a
 
card
 
effect
 
is
 
ambiguous,
 
it
 
is
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
players
 
and
 
gamemaster
 
to
 
work
 
out
 
a
 
quick
 
ruling
 
to
 
return
 
to
 
play.
 
In
 
situations
 
where
 
something
 
a
 
card
 
does
 
would
 
break
 
a
 
preestablished
 
rule,
 
the
 
card
 
effect
 
always
 
takes
 
precedence
 
over
 
the
 
rule.
 
 
The
 
following
 
Status
 
Effect
 
and
 
Card
 
Terminology
 
chapters
 
also
 
cover
 
common
 
standardized
 
card
 
effects
 
such
 
as
 
what
 
Burn
 
counters
 
do,
 
or
 
what
 
playing
 
a
 
[
Trick
]
 
means.
 
Multiple
 
Effect
 
Entries
 
Some
 
cards
 
have
 
multiple
 
effects
 
separated
 
by
 
lines.
 
This
 
means
 
you
 
resolve
 
each
 
effect
 
in
 
descending
 
order.
 
Some
 
cards
 
have
 
a
 
separate
 
[
Pitch
]
 
effect
 
that
 
can
 
only
 
work
 
when
 
the
 
card
 
is
 
pitched.
 
When
 
you
 
pitch
 
a
 
card,
 
do
 
not
 
resolve
 
any
 
of
 
its
 
other
 
effects.
 
Persistent
 
Effects
 
Most
 
cards
 
resolve
 
all
 
their
 
effects
 
the
 
moment
 
they
 
are
 
played,
 
though
 
some
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
persistent
 
effect
 
that
 
lasts
 
multiple
 
turns
 
or
 
even
 
rounds.
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
persistent
 
effects
 
last
 
forever.
 
If
 
a
 
persistent
 
effect
 
is
 
tied
 
to
 
a
 
specific
 
area,
 
it
 
is
 
referred
 
to
 
as
 
a
 
“lingering
 
area”.

Status
 
Effects
 
STATUS
 
EFFECTS
 
Status
 
effects
 
are
 
generic
 
persistent
 
effects
 
with
 
no
 
set
 
duration
 
measured
 
in
 
a
 
number
 
of
 
counters.
 
The
 
more
 
counters
 
a
 
character
 
has,
 
the
 
more
 
potent
 
the
 
status
 
effect
 
is.
 
 
By
 
default,
 
all
 
status
 
effects
 
except
 
Stun
 
and
 
Freeze
 
do
 
nothing
 
until
 
they
 
are
 
exploited.
 
When
 
you
 
exploit
 
a
 
counter,
 
remove
 
one
 
of
 
its
 
counters
 
then
 
apply
 
its
 
exploit
 
effect
 
to
 
the
 
character
 
that
 
counter
 
was
 
attached
 
to.
 
 
Exploiting
 
a
 
counter
 
counts
 
as
 
using
 
the
 
Invoke
 
action
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
 
There
 
are
 
two
 
types
 
of
 
status
 
effects:
 
positive
 
and
 
negative.
 
✦
 
You
 
can
 
only
 
exploit
 
positive
 
effects
 
on
 
allies.
 
✦
 
You
 
can
 
only
 
exploit
 
negative
 
effects
 
on
 
enemies.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
had
 
2
 
Burn
 
counters,
 
you
 
couldn’t
 
exploit
 
your
 
own
 
Burn
 
counters
 
to
 
inflict
 
damage
 
to
 
yourself.
 
 
You
 
can
 
remove
 
any
 
positive
 
or
 
negative
 
status
 
counters
 
on
 
yourself
 
by
 
taking
 
a
 
Cleanse
 
action
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
Certain
 
effects
 
may
 
also
 
cleanse
 
a
 
specific
 
amount
 
of
 
counters
 
as
 
well.
 
Basic
 
&
 
Alternate
 
Exploits
 
Each
 
status
 
effect
 
has
 
a
 
basic
 
exploit
 
effect
 
that
 
each
 
character
 
can
 
use.
 
Additionally,
 
certain
 
abilities
 
and
 
card
 
effects
 
grant
 
you
 
alternate
 
exploit
 
effects
 
you
 
can
 
use
 
instead
 
of
 
their
 
basic
 
exploit
 
effect.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
Ruthless
 
Lunge
 
and
 
use
 
its
 
alternate
 
exploit
 
effect
 
on
 
an
 
Expose
 
counter
 
the
 
enemy
 
it
 
targets
 
has,
 
you
 
would
 
automatically
 
hit
 
them
 
and
 
deal
 
an
 
extra
 
10
 
damage,
 
though
 
you
 
would
 
not
 
give
 
that
 
attack
 
[
Piercing
]
 
and
 
[
Overwhelm
]
 
unless
  
you
 
exploited
 
a
 
second
 
Expose
 
counter.
 
Stun
 
&
 
Freeze
 
Unlike
 
other
 
status
 
effects,
 
Stun
 
and
 
Freeze
 
do
 
not
 
have
 
a
 
basic
 
exploit
 
effect.
 
Instead,
 
they
 
have
 
a
 
persistent
 
effect
 
that
 
lasts
 
as
 
long
 
as
 
you
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
corresponding
 
status
 
counters.
 
 
 
Stun
 
and
 
Freeze
 
also
 
have
 
different
 
persistent
 
effects
 
depending
 
on
 
the
 
type
 
of
 
enemy
 
they
 
are
 
applied
 
to:
 
✦
 
Grunts,
 
Regulars,
 
and
 
Elite

only

Terminology
 
EFFECT
 
TERMINOLOGY
 
Certain
 
mechanics
 
are
 
common
 
enough
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
codified
 
as
 
keywords
 
and
 
phrases.
 
This
 
helps
 
reduce
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
text
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
read
 
on
 
each
 
card,
 
hopefully
 
making
 
it
 
less
 
overwhelming
 
to
 
read
 
your
 
hand.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
[
Knell/10
]
 
was
 
fully
 
written
 
out
 
on
 
the
 
card,
 
it
 
might
 
read
 
something
 
like
 
“If
 
any
 
damage
 
dealt
 
to
 
an
 
enemy
 
by
 
this
 
card
 
reduces
 
them
 
to
 
10
 
HP
 
or
 
less,
 
reduce
 
them
 
to
 
0
 
HP
 
instead.”
 
Colour
 
Coding
 
Most
 
keywords
 
and
 
phrases
 
are
 
highlighted
 
with
 
a
 
specific
 
colour.
 
These
 
act
 
as
 
quick
 
reminders
 
of
 
how
 
they
 
work:
 
✦
 
[
Light
 
Red
]
 
signifies
 
special
 
actions.
 
✦
 
[
Dark
 
Cyan
]
 
signifies
 
a
 
specific
 
character
 
state.
 
✦
 
[
Dark
 
Orange
]
 
signifies
 
an
 
attack
 
modification.
 
✦
 
[
Blue
]
 
signifies
 
an
 
effect
 
with
 
an
 
X
 
value.
 
✦
 
[
Grey
]
 
signifies
 
an
 
item-based
 
effect.
 
 
If
 
an
 
effect
 
covers
 
two
 
or
 
more
 
of
 
these
 
color
 
codes,
 
it
 
uses
 
whichever
 
one
 
is
 
more
 
relevant
 
to
 
how
 
it's
 
used.
 
 
 
A-M
 
Attack/Damag e
 
Bonuses
 
(+X/+Y)
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
says
 
that
 
an
 
attack
 
or
 
card
 
gets
 
a
 
+X/+Y
 
bonus,
 
you
 
should
 
read
 
it
 
as
 
“This
 
attack/card
 
gains
 
a
 
+X
 
bonus
 
to
 
each
 
attack
 
roll
 
it
 
makes,
 
and
 
deals
 
+Y
 
extra
 
damage
 
on
 
each
 
successful
 
hit”.
 
 
✦
 
If
 
the
 
bonus
 
specifies
 
a
 
card,
 
then
 
each
 
attack
 
that
 
card
 
makes
 
receives
 
the
 
bonus.
 
✦
 
If
 
the
 
bonus
 
only
 
mentions
 
a
 
single
 
attack
 
or
 
multi-attack,
 
then
 
only
 
those
 
mentioned
 
attacks
 
receive
 
the
 
bonus.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
Ars
 
Aeria
 
targeting
 
an
 
airborne
 
enemy,
 
that
 
card
 
gains
 
a
 
+5/+5
 
bonus
 
which
 
means
 
you
 
get
 
a
 
+5
 
bonus
 
to
 
hit
 
that
 
enemy,
 
and
 
it
 
deals
 
an
 
extra
 
5
 
damage
 
if
 
you
 
do.
 
 
Automatic
 
Parries
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
says
 
you
 
automatically
 
parry
 
an
 
attack,
 
treat
 
it
 
as
 
if
 
you
 
guarded
 
against
 
the
 
attack
 
with
 
a
 
Guard/20
 
token.
 
 
Basic
 
Attacks
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
asks
 
you
 
to
 
make
 
a
 
“basic

that
 
means
 
you
 
must
 
choose
 
and
 
resolve
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
two
 
following
 
attack
 
templates.
 
If
 
the
 
attack
 
is
 
more
 
specific
 
i.e.
 
“...make
 
a
 
basic
 
melee

you

Bloodied
 
Being
 
bloodied
 
is
 
used
 
as
 
an
 
effect
 
trigger.
 
A
 
character
 
is
 
considered
 
bloodied
 
whenever
 
their
 
current
 
HP
 
is
 
equal
 
to,
 
or
 
less
 
than
 
half
 
of
 
their
 
starting
 
maximum
 
HP.
 
Additionally,
 
after
 
a
 
character
 
is
 
downed
 
for
 
the
 
first
 
time,
 
they
 
remain
 
bloodied
 
for
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
encounter.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
started
 
the
 
encounter
 
with
 
50
 
HP,
 
you
 
become
 
bloodied
 
whenever
 
you
 
have
 
25
 
HP
 
or
 
less.
 
 
Bound
 
Areas
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
tells
 
you
 
to
 
place
 
a
 
bound
 
area
 
of
 
effect,
 
that
 
means
 
it
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
placed
 
if
 
you
 
are
 
within
 
that
 
area.
 
(remember
 
to
 
replace
 
a
 
lot
 
of
 
burst
 
effects
 
with
 
bound
 
word)
 
 
Cantrip
 
If
 
a
 
card
 
has
 
the
 
[
Cantrip
]
 
keyword,
 
it
 
can
 
be
 
cast
 
using
 
the
 
Cantrip

“Cares
 
about”
 
Effects
 
Certain
 
effects
 
only
 
trigger
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
a
 
card
 
that
 
the
 
effect
 
“cares
 
about”.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
Eye
 
of
 
the
 
Hurricane
 
gives
 
you
 
1
 
Swift
 
counter
 
whenever
 
you
 
successfully
 
resolve
 
a
 
melee
 
card.
 
 
✦
 
Attack
 
cards
 
are
 
any
 
card
 
that
 
makes
 
an
 
attack.
 
✦
 
Area
 
cards
 
are
 
any
 
card
 
that
 
places
 
an
 
area.
 
✦
 
Melee
 
cards
 
are
 
any
 
cards
 
with
 
“Melee”
 
and/or
 
“Melee
 
Weapon”
 
in
 
its
 
range
 
entry.
 
✦
 
Standard

have
 
two
 
coloured
 
edges.
 
✦
 
Nonstandard
 
cards
 
have
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
black
 
edges.
 
 
Chained
 
Effects
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
is
 
“chained”,
 
you
 
must
 
repeat
 
that
 
attack
 
or
 
effect
 
targeting
 
a
 
different
 
character
 
within
 
range
 
of
 
the
 
previous
 
target.
 
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
milled
 
4
 
cards
 
when
 
playing
 
Arcing
 
Shockbolt
,
 
you
 
would
 
attack
 
a
 
target,
 
then
 
chain
 
that
 
attack
 
on
 
an
 
enemy
 
within
 
3
 
squares
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
target,
 
and
 
then
 
chain
 
it
 
again
 
on
 
another
 
enemy
 
within
 
3
 
squares
 
of
 
the
 
second
 
target.
 
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
any
 
target
 
of
 
a
 
chained
 
effect
 
doesn’t
 
need
 
to
 
be
 
within
 
range
 
of
 
you
 
to
 
resolve,
 
but
 
it
 
can
 
only
 
use
 
the
 
chained
 
effects
 
standard
 
range.
 
 
In
 
the
 
example
 
above,
 
you
 
could
 
channel
 
Arcing
 
Shockbolt
 
with
 
a
 
longbow
 
to
 
hit
 
an
 
enemy
 
5
 
squares
 
away
 
with
 
the
 
initial
 
attack,
 
but
 
each
 
of
 
its
 
chained
 
attacks
 
could
 
only
 
reach
 
3
 
squares
 
away.
 
 
Choic e
 
Effects
 
Certain
 
cards
 
will
 
present
 
you
 
with
 
multiple,
 
often
 
mutually
 
exclusive
 
effects
 
that
 
you
 
can
 
choose
 
from.
 
The
 
effect(s)
 
you
 
choose
 
are
 
resolved
 
normally,
 
whereas
 
the
 
effects
 
you
 
didn’t
 
choose
 
are
 
treated
 
as
 
if
 
they
 
weren’t
 
written
 
on
 
the
 
card.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
Galeforce
 
Sweep
 
card
 
asks
 
you
 
to
 
choose
 
“high”
 
or
 
“low”.
 
If
 
you
 
choose
 
high,
 
it
 
deals
 
more
 
damage,
 
and
 
if
 
you
 
choose
 
low,
 
it
 
sweeps
 
your
 
enemies
 
feet
 
and
 
stuns
 
them.
 
 
Cleanse
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
asks
 
you
 
to
 
cleanse,
 
that
 
means
 
you
 
can
 
remove
 
that
 
many
 
status
 
counters
 
from
 
the
 
character
 
that
 
is
 
being
 
cleansed.
 
 
Critical /X
 
If
 
the
 
roll
 
result
 
of
 
an
 
attack
 
roll
 
is
 
equal
 
to
 
the
 
critical
 
threshold
 
(X)
 
or
 
higher,
 
empower
 
that
 
attack
 
(see
 
below).
 
 
 
Attacks
 
that
 
automatically
 
hit,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
fixed
 
attack
 
rolls
 
using
 
the
 
Fix
 
action
 
(Pg.
 
XX)
 
can
 
trigger
 
critical
 
hits
 
as
 
well.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
make
 
an
 
attack
 
with
 
[
Critical/15
]
 
that
 
deals
 
5
 
damage
 
and
 
you
 
roll
 
a
 
16,
 
it
 
would
 
deal
 
15
 
damage
 
instead.
 
 
 
 
 
Empo wer
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
says
 
to
 
“empower”
 
an
 
attack
 
roll,
 
treat
 
that
 
attack
 
as
 
if
 
you
 
exploited
 
an
 
Empower
 
counter
 
on
 
it
 
i.e.
 
the
 
attack
 
gains
 
a
 
+0/+10
 
bonus
 
that
 
doesn’t
 
stack
 
with
 
itself.
 
 
Enchantment
 
Effects
 
An
 
enchantment
 
is
 
a
 
specific
 
type
 
of
 
persistent
 
effect
 
that
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
modify
 
objects
 
and
 
characters.
 
Most
 
enchantments
 
have
 
an
 
upkeep
 
that
 
must
 
be
 
paid
 
each
 
turn,
 
or
 
the
 
enchantment
 
wears
 
off.
 
 
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
Earthsteel
 
Aegis
 
card
 
gives
 
the
 
enchanted
 
character
 
Guard
 
tokens,
 
but
 
requires
 
the
 
enchanted
 
character
 
to
 
discard
 
a
 
card
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
each
 
round.
 
If
 
they
 
don’t,
 
then
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
Earthsteel
 
Aegis
 
wear
 
off
 
and
 
they
 
lose
 
all
 
those
 
tokens.
 
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
each
 
unique
 
enchantment
 
effect
 
does
 
not
 
stack.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
someone
 
is
 
already
 
enchanted
 
with
 
the
 
Earthsteel
 
Aegis
,
 
you
 
could
 
not
 
apply
 
that
 
enchantment
 
to
 
them
 
again
 
until
 
the
 
preexisting
 
instance
 
wore
 
off.
 
 
Expendable
 
This
 
keyword
 
is
 
used
 
for
 
items
 
and
 
artefacts.
 
An
 
item
 
with
 
[
Expendable
]
 
can
 
only
 
be
 
used
 
X
 
number
 
of
 
times.
 
After
 
combat
 
ends,
 
items
 
with
 
[
Expendable
]
 
regain
 
all
 
of
 
their
 
lost
 
uses.
 
 
Fixed
 
An
 
attack
 
roll
 
is
 
considered
 
“fixed”
 
when
 
an
 
effect
 
replaces
  
the
 
dice
 
roll
 
with
 
a
 
static
 
result.
 
Most
 
often
 
this
 
happens
 
by
 
using
 
the
 
Fix
 
action
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
A
 
card
 
being
 
“fixed”
 
also
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
trigger
 
for
 
some
 
cards
 
and
 
abilities.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
Starseeker’s
 
Surge
 
and
 
fix
 
its
 
attack
 
roll,
 
it
 
gains
 
a
 
+3/+3
 
bonus
 
and
 
[
Overwhelm
].
 
 
Foretold/X
 
After
 
the
 
draw
 
step,
 
you
 
may
 
play
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
cards
 
with
 
[
Foretold/X
]
 
as
 
a
 
[
Trick
].
 
If
 
you
 
do,
 
do
 
not
 
resolve
 
its
 
effects.
 
You
 
must
 
then
 
predetermine
 
who
 
the
 
targets
 
will
 
be,
 
and
 
where
 
any
 
areas
 
will
 
be
 
placed.
 
 
After
 
X
 
turns
 
on
 
the
 
timer
 
has
 
passed,
 
or
 
at
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
round
 
(whichever
 
comes
 
first),
 
resolve
 
the
 
[
Foretold
]
 
card
 
as
 
a
 
[
Trick
]
 
against
 
those
 
predetermined
 
targets
 
and
 
areas.
 
 
If
 
a
 
predetermined
 
target
 
falls
 
out
 
of
 
range
 
of
 
the
 
foretold
 
effect,
 
that
 
effect
 
fails
 
to
 
resolve
 
against
 
that
 
target.
 
 
Knell /X
 
If
 
any
 
damage
 
dealt
 
to
 
an
 
enemy
 
by
 
an
 
attack
 
with
 
[
Knell/X
]
 
reduces
 
them
 
to
 
X
 
HP
 
or
 
less,
 
reduce
 
them
 
to
 
0
 
HP
 
instead.
 
If
 
an
 
attack
 
has
 
multiple
 
sources
 
of
 
[
Knell
],
 
add
 
all
 
of
 
them
 
together.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
two
 
sources
 
each
 
provide
 
[
Knell/15
]
 
to
 
an
 
attack,
 
that
 
attack
 
effectively
 
has
 
[
Knell/30
].

An

Summon
 
When
 
an
 
effect
 
asks
 
you
 
to
 
summon
 
a
 
minion,
 
choose
 
an
 
unoccupied
 
square
 
within
 
range,
 
then
 
place
 
a
 
token
 
representing
 
that
 
minion
 
onto
 
that
 
square.
 
If
 
your
 
minion
 
is
 
larger
 
than
 
1
 
square,
 
then
 
each
 
of
 
those
 
squares
 
must
 
be
 
unoccupied
 
and
 
fall
 
within
 
range
 
of
 
the
 
summoning
 
effect.
 
 
Strik e,
 
Guar d,
 
and
 
Protect
 
Tokens
 
These
 
tokens
 
can
 
be
 
expended
 
in
 
lieu
 
of
 
discarding
 
a
 
card
 
to
 
take
 
the
 
corresponding
 
Fix,
 
Guard,
 
and
 
Protection
 
actions
 
(Pgs.
 
XX,

Each
 
token
 
has
 
an
 
X
 
value
 
that
 
determines
 
its
 
Strike
 
or
 
Guard
 
value
 
when
 
expended.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
Strike/10
 
token
 
has
 
a
 
Strike
 
value
 
of
 
10.
 
 
Protect
 
tokens
 
have
 
an
 
additional
 
value
 
that
 
determines
 
how
 
far
 
it
 
can
 
reach.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
Protect/2/10
 
token
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
protect
 
an
 
ally
 
up
 
to
 
2

with
 
a

value
 
of

Taunting
 
When
 
you
 
taunt
 
an
 
enemy,
 
they
 
must
 
always
 
target
 
you
 
or
 
any
 
minions
 
you
 
control
 
with
 
attacks
 
and
 
harmful
 
effects
 
if
 
possible.
 
If
 
you
 
are

of
 
range,
 
but
 
they
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
move
 
close
 
enough
 
to
 
target
 
you,
 
they
 
will
 
proceed
 
to
 
do
 
so.
 
 
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
taunting
 
lasts
 
until
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
round.
 
 
If
 
a
 
taunted
 
enemy
 
is
 
unable
 
to
 
target
 
you
 
with
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
attack
 
or
 
harmful
 
effect
 
during
 
their
 
turn,
 
they
 
cease
 
to
 
be
 
taunted.
 
If
 
you
 
are
 
downed,
 
you
 
cease
 
to
 
taunt
 
all
 
enemies.

If

of
 
the

Minion
 
Attributes
 
In
 
addition
 
to
 
its
 
name

types,
 
each
 
minion
 
has
 
a
 
combat,
 
defence,
 
health
 
points,
 
movement
 
points,
 
and
 
upkeep
 
attribute.
 
 
Minion
 
Types
 
Each
 
minion
 
has
 
the
 
“Minion”
 
type
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
five
 
combat
 
NPC-types
 
i.e.
 
grunt,
 
regular,
 
elite,
 
minor
 
boss,
 
or
 
boss.
 
Some
 
may
 
also
 
have
 
more
 
descriptive
 
types
 
such
 
as
 
constructs,
 
elementals,
 
spirits,
 
beasts,
 
and
 
so
 
on.
 
Like
 
with
 
enemy
 
NPCs,
 
types
 
are
 
important
 
for
 
effects
 
that
 
trigger
 
based
 
on
 
what
 
types
 
they
 
have.
 
Combat
 
Attribute
 
Like
 
most
 
enemy
 
NPCs,
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
important
 
to
 
keep
 
track
 
of
 
a
 
minion's
 
Might,
 
Agility,
 
and
 
Will
 
attributes.
 
Instead,
 
they
 
have
 
an
 
“all-in-one”
 
attribute
 
simply
 
called
 
Combat.
 
 
Whenever
 
an
 
effect
 
that
 
would
 
normally
 
modify
 
the
 
target’s
 
Might,
 
Agility,
 
or
 
Will
 
affects
 
a
 
minion,
 
it
 
changes
 
their
 
Combat
 
by
 
that
 
amount
 
instead.
 
Similarly,
 
when
 
an
 
effect
 
asks
 
for
 
a
 
specific
 
attribute,
 
the
 
minion
 
can
 
always
 
substitute
 
the
 
required
 
attribute
 
with
 
their
 
Combat
 
attribute.
 
 
When
 
reading
 
a
 
minion
 
sheet,
 
Combat
 
is
 
highlighted
 
in
 
red
,
 
and
 
is
 
already
 
included
 
within
 
each
 
of
 
its
 
attack
 
templates.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
Bark
 
&
 
Bite
 
deals
 
“7
 
+
 
Combat”
 
damage,
 
but
 
this
 
is
 
written
 
on
 
the
 
Swiftwood
 
Wolf’s
 
minion
 
sheet
 
as
 
“7
 
+
 
3
”
 
Minion
 
Defence
 
Defence
 
is
 
the
 
same
 
for
 
minions
 
except
 
for
 
those
 
with
 
the
 
Grunt-type
 
which
 
have
 
no
 
Defence
 
value
 
at
 
all.
 
This
 
means
 
an
 
enemy
 
targeting
 
a
 
Grunt
 
always
 
hits
 
them
 
unless
 
they
 
are
 
protected
 
by
 
a
 
non-Grunt
 
character.

from
 
the
 
battlefield
 
the
 
first
 
time
 
they
 
are
 
downed.

any
 
of
 
its
 
minion

Minion
 
Upkeep
 
When
 
summoned,
 
a
 
minion
 
will
 
take
 
up
 
a
 
certain
 
amount
 
of
 
its
 
controller’s
 
command
 
capacity
 
by
 
an
 
amount
 
equal
 
to
 
its
 
Upkeep
 
value.
 
If
 
you
 
try
 
to
 
summon
 
a
 
minion
 
when
 
it
 
would
 
go
 
beyond
 
your
 
command
 
capacity,
 
that
 
effect
 
fails
 
to
 
resolve.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
have
 
a
 
command
 
capacity
 
of
 
12,
 
you
 
could
 
control

passive
 
ability

When
 
a
 
minion
 
effect
 
says
 
for
 
“you”

something,
 
it
 
is
 
referring
 
to
 
the

You,
 
the

you
 
would
 
need

corresponding
 
★
 
cost.
 
 
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
a
 
minion
 
can
 
only
 
take
 
3
 
minion
 
actions
 
each
 
turn.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
control
 
a
 
Swiftwood
 
Wolf
 
with
 
4

you
 
could
 
only
 
direct
 
it
 
to
 
make
 
up
 
to
 
three
 
Bark
 
&
 
Bite
 
attacks
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
turn.
 
Minion
 
Attack
 
Templates
 
Most
 
minions
 
have
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
attack
 
templates
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
by
 
triggering
 
an
 
ability
 
or
 
using
 
a
 
minion
 
action.
 
Each
 
attack
 
template
 
is
 
formatted
 
similarly
 
to
 
the
 
basic
 
melee
 
and
 
ranged
 
attacks
 
(Pg.
 
XX).
 
 
 
Objects
 
Each
 
object
 
has
 
a
 
special
 
NPC
 
sheet
 
with
 
only
 
four
 
elements:
 
its
 
name,
 
types,
 
health,
 
and
 
abilities.
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
objects
 
only
 
take
 
up
 
1
 
square.
 
 
 
Objects
 
can’t
 
take
 
actions.
 
Like
 
Grunt-type
 
NPCS,
 
objects
 
have
 
no
 
Defence
 
attribute.
 
This
 
means
 
attacking
 
an
 
object
 
always
 
hits,
 
unless
 
a
 
character
 
attempts
 
to
 
protect
 
it.
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
objects
 
only
 
take
 
up

it

each

Object
 
Types
 
Much
 
like
 
minions,
 
objects
 
are
 
given
 
types
 
to
 
trigger
 
certain
 
effects
 
that
 
care
 
about
 
specific
 
typing.
 
Each
 
object
 
has
 
the
 
Object
 
type,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
one
 
or
 
two
 
descriptive
 
types
 
such
 
as
 
Plant,
 
Stone,
 
Ice,
 
and
 
so
 
on.
 
Object
 
Health
 
HP
 
doesn’t
 
act
 
differently
 
for
 
objects.
 
Unless
 
otherwise
 
specified,
 
objects
 
are
 
removed
 
from
 
the
 
battlefield
 
whenever
 
they
 
are
 
reduced
 
to
 
0
 
HP.
 
If
 
an
 
object
 
has
 
“∞”
 
HP,
 
it
 
cannot
 
be
 
damaged.
 
Object
 
Abilities
 
Most
 
objects
 
have
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
passive
 
ability,
 
or
 
an
 
active
 
ability
 
that
 
other
 
characters
 
can
 
use.
 
An
 
object
 
can’t
 
use
 
its
 
own
 
active
 
abilities.

PERSONAL
 
EQUIPMENT
 
Each
 
mage
 
wields
 
a
 
fantastic
 
amount
 
of
 
power,
 
but
 
a
 
sword
 
is
 
still
 
a
 
sword
 
and
 
a
 
wound
 
is
 
still
 
a
 
wound.
 
Mundane
 
gear
 
and
 
weak
 
magic
 
items
 
such
 
as
 
Lesser
 
Manalyths
 
can
 
be
 
procured
 
within
 
the
 
borders
 
of
 
Azirland
 
at
 
no
 
cost.
 
Outside
 
of
 
its
 
borders
 
however,
 
you
 
may
 
need
 
to
 
procure
 
the
 
local
 
current
 
to
 
bargain
 
for
 
gear,
 
or
 
even
 
steal
 
it
 
if
 
you
 
wish.
 
 
Anything
 
not
 
covered
 
in
 
this
 
chapter
 
such
 
as
 
clothing,
 
pack
 
animals,
 
wagons,
 
food,
 
tools,
 
tents,
 
and
 
so
 
on
 
can
 
be
 
acquired
 
as
 
desired.
 
They
 
may
 
be
 
important
 
to
 
the
 
story,
 
or
 
your
 
character,
 
but
 
serve
 
no
 
role
 
in
 
combat.
 
 
When
 
it
 
comes
 
to
 
your
 
personal
 
effects,
 
you
 
do
 
not
 
need
 
to
 
keep
 
track
 
of
 
things
 
like
 
weight
 
or
 
storage.
 
Just
 
whatever
 
you
 
feel
 
your
 
character
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
carry
 
with
 
them.
 
If
 
it
 
fits
 
your
 
character,
 
you
 
might
 
even
 
declare
 
they
 
have
 
magical
 
means
 
of
 
storage
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
walking
 
chest,

Item
 
Basics
 
When
 
you
 
equip
 
an
 
item,
 
you
 
are
 
able
 
to
 
use
 
it
 
during
 
a
 
combat
 
encounter.
 
Each
 
item
 
takes
 
up
 
at
 
least
 
1
 
of
 
your
 
equipment
 
slots.
 
You
 
cannot
 
equip
 
or
 
unequip
 
items
 
during
 
combat.
 
Weapon
 
Channeling
 
Certain
 
cards
 
have
 
range
 
entries
 
that
 
say
 
“Melee
 
Weapon”
 
or
 
“Ranged
 
Weapon”.
 
This
 
means
 
that
 
the
 
card
 
can
 
be
 
channeled
 
through
 
a
 
single
 
weapon
 
of
 
the
 
corresponding
 
type.
 
This
 
grants
 
that
 
card
 
the
 
weapon’s
 
range
 
value
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
any
 
of
 
its
 
weapon
 
effects.
 
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
you
 
play
 
Earthsteel
 
Bash
 
and
 
channel
 
it
 
through
 
a
 
dagger,
 
it
 
would
 
gain
 
[
Piercing
].
 
Personal
 
Armour
 
Regardless
 
of
 
how
 
many
 
equipment
 
slots
 
you
 
have,
 
you
 
may
 
only
 
equip
 
one
 
piece
 
of
 
head
 
armour,
 
one
 
piece
 
of
 
body
 
armour,
 
and
 
one
 
shield
 
at
 
a
 
time.
 
 
 
If
 
you
 
wish
 
to
 
be
 
more
 
“mage”
 
and
 
less
 
“knight”,
 
you
 
can
 
represent
 
each
 
piece
 
of
 
armour
 
as
 
an
 
item
 
enchanted
 
with
 
defensive
 
wards
 
such
 
as
 
magic
 
robes,
 
amulets,
 
rings,
 
and
 
so
 
on.

After
 
combat
 
ends,
 
each

with

regains
 
any

When

the
